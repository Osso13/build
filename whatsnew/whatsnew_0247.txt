8854: news_r4k.cpp: Implement Sony NEWS NWS-5000X driver [briceonk]
Opening as a draft to get feedback (I'm sure there is a lot of stuff I will need to fix!). 
It is still a draft because I still need to figure out the MIPS3 DRC version of the SCACHE tag manipulation, right now only the
  interpreted version has it. The NEWS-OS 4.2.1aRD bootloader is incompatible with DRC, so it doesn't impact the NWS-5000X driver,
  but it would diverge the two for the r4400sc subclass.
For more information about using this driver, please see https://github.com/briceonk/news-os/blob/master/nws5000x-mame.md
In its current state, this driver will only boot NEWS-OS 4.2.1aRD. NEWS-OS 6 has booting issues (perhaps related to the async serial
  driver, I haven't spent much time on it yet), and the SPIFI driver doesn't work with NetBSD yet, so only the floppy installer will
  boot for NetBSD. Additionally, NetBSD only works with DRC enabled for some reason on the MIPS3 driver (but not with r4000.cpp), so
  it would require a recompile to use it anyways since it is set to force DRC off to support NEWS-OS.
Changes made outside of the new driver and devices:
- Added support for the TimIntDis configuration to the MIPS3 and R4000.cpp drivers
- Added basic support for WREQ RX and DTR/REQ to z80scc
- Added additional big-endian support to the SONIC driver
- Updated the SONIC driver to allow for packet appending when a transfer is already in progress

9119: Initial FAT file system support for Floptool [npwoods]
Current Limitations:
- Read only
- Only supports partitioned hard drives
	- Always accesses first supported partition
	- Floptool needs a way for partioning schemes to be indepenent of the file systems contained therein
- No FAT32 support
- No Long Filenames Support

Casio Celviano AP-10 [Devin Acker]
Casio CTK-601 [Devin Acker, Gabriel Miceli]
Casio GZ-70SP [Devin Acker]
These are three more GT913-based MIDI devices. Aside from the ROM definitions etc., this PR also:
* gives the GT913 a more complete CPU implementation and improved sound emulation. This includes replacing the
  `required_memory_bank` with a new address space, not just because it needs to be able to contain read/write handlers, but also
  because the bank-switchable memory is accessible not just through the regular program space but also through a special mode of
  indirect addressing (see `gt913_device::read8ib`, `write8ib`, etc.)
* Fixes the H8/300 `subx.b` instruction with regard to how it affects the Z flag. This was verified against docs from Renesas and is
  necessary for both of these machines to run because of how they perform 16-bit comparisons.

9949: Intel MDS-II: correct dump for PIO & regression fixes [fulivi]
Hi,
this PR is for a couple of changes to imds2 driver.
- The correct dump for PIO controller has been added
- A regression introduced by 4287970 has been fixed. The iSBC202 floppy controller broke because of this regression.
Thanks.

9970: magicard driver: add required devices. nvram config files, Implement new devices [Paul-Arnold]
This PR adds the required devices to the magicard driver.
SCC66470 and DS1207 are newly supported and only tested magicard.
The Dallas DS1207 and DS2401 devices haven't been dumped so fake/dummy dumps have been created.
A number of games fail on power up if the battery backed NVR isn't initialised. This can be initialised in the game but  it's not
  always obvious how so I've included default nvram files to fix this. If this isn't allowed please let me know and I'll remove.
Five of the games appear to be functional. The others require more work and/or protection devices dumping.
I can email the modified game zip files with the added files when required.

The Italian sets are not hacks. Gaelco licensed the game to Playmark for the Italian market, so changed the manufacturer accordingly
  on the Italian sets.
Finally, the Rev A on the piggyback PCB refers to the game revision, not the PCB revision, so, changed the games names removing the
  "PCB" reference (although all sets are Rev A, even if the game expects a different MCU program version).

10136: dmac3.cpp, cxd8442q.cpp: Implement DMAC3 and WSC-FIFOQ DMA controllers [briceonk]
More split-out commits from the NWS-5000X driver to make it easier to review. This commit implements the SCSI (CXD8403Q DMAC3) and
  low-speed I/O (CXD8442Q WSC-FIFOQ) DMA controllers used by the NWS-5000 series.
See https://github.com/briceonk/news-os/blob/master/nws5000x-board-pictures.md for pictures.
There is no public documentation about these chips (that I could find, anyways), so the functionality is based on what the monitor
  ROM and NEWS-OS 4.2.1aRD/FCS#2 do with them.
The DMAC3 is a fairly standard DMA controller with two channels, one per SPIFI SCSI controller. It has the ability to use physical
  addresses as well as APbus virtual addresses. APbus virtual addresses use the central APbus TLB/map RAM on the platform to map
  virtual addresses loaded into the `address` register to their physical equivalent. There are some bits related to error handling
  I'm not sure how to emulate yet, but thankfully those aren't needed for normal operation.
The WSC-FIFOQ does have some "normal" DMA capabilities, but it exposes its data as a FIFO (presumably where the name comes from :D).
  It has a register that will read/write data byte by byte for the CPU. The NWS-5000X has two of these chips and uses them for
  serial port communication, floppy disk I/O, and sound. Like DMAC3, some things are unemulated. Additionally, I'm pretty sure the
  FIFOQ hardware has some sort of buffer threshold before it interrupts the CPU in terms of data received. Looking at the register
  transactions, it didn't immediately jump out at me what it would be (if it is configurable), but that can probably be improved in
  the future.

10137: spifi3.cpp: Implement HP 1TV3-0302 SPIFI3 SCSI controller [briceonk]
Another split from #8854 with the HP SPIFI3 emulator. Like most of the custom Sony silicon that the NWS-5000X uses, the SPIFI3
  doesn't have much in the way of public documentation. So, this only implements what NEWS-OS uses (although it could be updated to
  support NetBSD as well, it partially works with NetBSD already but has some LUN issues that NEWS-OS doesn't). Major thanks to
  Olivier Galibert and Patrick; having the bones of the SCSI state machine from the NCR and CXD SCSI controllers to reference made
  this way easier than it would have been otherwise :) Can't say I'd be itching to RE another SCSI controller without a datasheet,
  though...

10138: arsystems.cpp: Mark dumps of protected PLDs as NO_DUMP, as they contain no info [clawgrip]

10140: cloned the mcs51 core as axc51, stripped it back, will allow monon work to continue without making a mess of the original
  mcs51 core. [DavidHaywood]
as @ajrhacker didn't really want the axc51 modifications in the base mcs51 core I've pulled them out and put them in their own
  stripped back version if it.
note, this is kinda ugly before, in part owing to the mcs51 core being ugly (I haven't cleaned up any of that code) but if prevents
  progress from being blocked entirely on the monon work, it seems more sensible to do this now rather than later.

CP/68 is an operating system for the SWTPC 6800 computer which was

Because the operating system source code was published in the book the

- Also fix baud counter registers
Reference: http://www.zilog.com/docs/serial/ps0117.pdf
The X68000 uses the Clock Mode feature of the SCC, which multiplies the baud period by 16. Combined with a bug that read the baud
  counter from the wrong registers, this meant the emulator had two baud rate expiry callbacks running at some MHz.
The x68k driver doesn't implement RS232 and doesn't yet use the SCC IRQs for mouse updates, so this doesn't yet affect the driver
  directly, but it does improve performance.

10195: nintendo/vsnes.cpp: Various cleanups. [0kmg]
- Merged vsnes_m.cpp and vsnes.h into vsnes.cpp.
- Split into base class and three separate classes for UniSystem, DualSystem, and SMB bootleg machines.
- Merged DualSystem's main/sub VROM banking functions.

10196: tsconf.cpp: start software list [holub]
\+ minor cleanup

10197: jpm/jpmsru.cpp: Added Lite a Line, cleaned up the driver [SomeRandomGuyIdk]
- Added support for Lite a Line, a Dutch game together with a very basic handmade layout
- Some cleanups to the driver
- Added a postload callback to fix j_ewnc not updating reels after loading a save state
- Order of display digit outputs has changed to reflect the actual order in the memory map

10198: pentagon.cpp: cleanup driver detection [holub]
per #10194 review

10199: sinclair/spectrum.cpp: Play cassette output through speaker (MT08342) [holub]

10200: nintendo/nes.cpp: Added an RGB Famicom clone. [0kmg]
New working clones
------------------
My Computer Terebi C1 [kmg]
The 2C0x palette is the standard one found in PlayChoice-10 and VS. The builtin ROM was in the software list, but the PRG was an
  overdump (repeated data). I verified the size at least is correct by looking at the PCB.

10201: pacman.cpp: Added Miss Packman Plus. [mdeslaur]
This adds support for the Miss Packman Plus roms that have the alternate mazes.

10202: Various software lists: Cleaned up more extraneous spaces. [0kmg]
Note there's a weird Unicode code point after the word "Turbo" in the second changed line in a800.xml. It has been removed but
  doesn't show up on GitHub's diff. Same issue in this file popped up in #8112.

10205: nintendo/vsnes.cpp: A few minor changes. [0kmg]
- Added watchdog timer (currently only active on DualSystem games).
- Set perfect quantum for vsmahjng, just like all the other DualSystem games.
- Switched vssoccera from bnglngby's init, which installs a fake IRQ hack, to standard init.
- Switched suprmriobl to empty_init and gave it more consistent function naming.

10206: sinclair/atm.cpp: Use more descriptive BIOS names [holub]

10207: midw8080/m79amb.cpp: Invert PROM data using region flags [0kmg]

10208: nintendo/playch10.cpp: Replaced pc_gntlt PRG and CHR dumps. [0kmg]
- Removed MACHINE_IMPERFECT_GRAPHICS flag from pc_gntlt. [kmg]
- Added MACHINE_IMPERFECT_GRAPHICS flag for pc_cshwk. [Dullaron]
Dumps are identical to the NES version. The PC-10 Gauntlet board is seen with mask roms with identical labels, so this should be
  correct—Nintendo is fastidious about labeling revisions. The old dump has garbled graphics/text at the bottom of the title screen
  and possibly other issues. It turns out this was not an emulation bug.

10213: Dumped and added "Project Justice / Moero! Justice Gakuen (Rev B)" [clawgrip]
New NOT_WORKING clones
----------------------------------
Project Justice / Moero! Justice Gakuen (Rev B) [Tailsnic Retroworks]

10214: nintendo/playch10.cpp: Merged playch10 source files. [0kmg]
- Added finders for joystick and gun inputs.
- Fixed some bad masks (sprite DMA write and Pin-Bot).
- Made color PROM loading more concise.
- Removed pc_1942 imperfect graphics flag. It looks as bad as it should.
- Various other minor cleanups.

10215: snes.xml: Promoted dsp1demo to working. [0kmg]
Software list items promoted to working
---------------------------------------
DSP1 Tech Demo (USA, prototype)
An identical binary has been dumped from a different prototype board, so this isn't corrupt.

10217: atm.cpp: add CMOS [holub]
* atm.cpp: add CMOS
* glukrs.cpp: refactoring

10218: cxd8452aq.cpp: Add WSC-SONIC3 DMA controller support [briceonk]
This is the last device needed for #8854 :) The driver implements the WSC-SONIC3, the DMA controller used with a National Semi SONIC
  ethernet controller for networking on the Sony NEWS NWS-5000 series. It uses the same APbus address translation mechanism as
  DMAC3.

10219: bus/nes: Updated emulation of TXC 01-22000-400 PCBs. [0kmg]

10221: imagedev/midiin.cpp: send All Notes Off CC when unloading a MIDI file [devinacker]
Just so stopping a MIDI file input mid-playback doesn't leave notes hanging on the receiving device. Not sure if this should be tied
  to another config option or something just so it doesn't risk doing anything weird to non-GM devices, though.

----------------------------------
Dance Dance Revolution Karaoke Mix 2 (GQ947 VER. JAA) [Taro]

10225: sega/model3.cpp: Add US Title to most Scud Race sets. [mikehyrus]
The US Title (Sega Super GT) is known to exist on most (but not all) sets via service mode when you change region settings.

10226: sinclair/atm.cpp: Fixed I/O addressing, and disabled RAM writes when ROM is active [holub]
/removed/

10228: nintendo/vsnes.cpp: Fixed some DIP switch issues. [0kmg]
- Removed nonexistent P3 and P4 controls from starlstr.
- Corrected credits per game mode DIP switch for vstennis.
- Removed redundant inputs for vsbballj, which are identical to vsbball.

10231: cdrom: Pass phys flag to read_partial_sector in read_subcode [987123879113]
This fixes the data roundtrip problem mentioned in https://github.com/mamedev/mame/issues/10230. This does not address the TOC
  returning `CD_ROM` instead of `CD_ROM_XA` that is mentioned in the same issue.
As a test I used a toc/bin I had on hand and went from bin/toc -> chd -> bin/toc and verified the SHA-1 of the two BINs matched.
  Additionally, I tried some redump PS1 bin/cue files I had on hand and verified that the SHA-1 resulting of the BIN after doing
  bin/cue -> chd -> bin/cue matches the file I had on hand and also what was listed on the redump website. (see:
  https://github.com/mamedev/mame/issues/10230#issuecomment-1215996922)
Additionally, the `phys` parameter of `read_partial_sector` has a default value of `false` which made this bug go unnoticed for a
  long time. All usages of `read_partial_sector` except this one instance already pass a value in for `phys` so I removed the
  default value from the function so this problem can't happening again. Also updated the inline docs for the function since it was
  missing the `phys` parameter.

10232: konami/ksys573.cpp: Add Guitar Freaks (EAA/UAA/JAA/AAA) [987123879113]
Just a small note because the naming is now inconsistent with the other namings but for a reason: based on the existing naming
  scheme in the ksys573 driver, the European build should've been named `gtrfrksa` (EAD is `gtrfrks`, EAC is `gtrfrksc`, so EAA
  should be `gtrfrksa`) but `gtrfrksa` is already in use by the AAD version so I made what should've been `gtrfrksa` into
  `gtrfrksea` for this commit.
The security ROM is the same one shared between the xAD and xAC builds.

10233: chdman: Fix TOC session type detection for extractcd [987123879113]
Fixes issue mentioned in https://github.com/mamedev/mame/issues/10230 where `CD_ROM_XA` is expected but `CD_ROM` is written.
  Additionally, I implemented the `CD_DA` session type based on the information found in cdrdao.
The logic used follows cdrdao's cue2toc code
  (https://github.com/cdrdao/cdrdao/blob/3787686d6f49687ce1b553236482078761e511de/trackdb/Cue2Toc.cc#L605-L642) and matches what's
  written in the man file (https://github.com/cdrdao/cdrdao/blob/3787686d6f49687ce1b553236482078761e511de/dao/cdrdao.man#L458-L466).
Test TOCs can be found on the cdrdao repo: https://github.com/cdrdao/cdrdao/tree/master/testtocs
I tested the following:
- `CD_ROM` is written when there is mode1 tracks but no mode2
- `CD_ROM_XA` is written when there is a mode2 track (converted a PS1 bin/cue -> chd -> bin/toc to verify this)
- `CD_DA` is written when there is only audio tracks (converted an audio only bin/cue -> chd -> bin/toc to verify this)

10234: formats/flex_dsk.cpp: Add FLEX 1.0 (MiniFLEX) Disk Format [n6il]
The FLEX 1.0 (MiniFLEX) Operating System for the SWTPC MF-68 Disk System
was released in 1978 and replaced the prior FDOS Operating System.  The
MiniFLEX Disk Format is notably different from later versions of FLEX.
MiniFLEX uses 18 sectors of 128-bytes per track. Later versions of FLEX
used 256-byte sectors.  Disk images from both deramp.com and
https://github.com/rsanchovilla/SimH_cpanel work with this change.

10235: astrcorp.cpp protection and layouts update [LucaElia]
astrcorp.cpp protection and layouts update: [Luca Elia]
* Emulated the "CPU Code" protection in newer games (astoneag, dinodino, hacher, magibombd, winbingo, winbingoa, zoo).
* Expanded ROM patches to work around imperfect data in the first 0x400 bytes (ROM overlay?), getting all games to boot.
* Implemented 16x32 sprites in astoneag.
* Created layouts and factory defaults EEPROMs for all sets.
* showhand: Fixed regression that caused the new opponent face to be invisible while entering the screen.

Declare as unused some return variables

10252: kpython2: Add new skeleton driver [987123879113]
kpython and kpython2 share nothing in common besides the fact that they're PS2-based so I split kpython2 into its own driver. 
The HDD images were made by installing the game data onto a fresh HDD. All HDDs have been tested to make sure they boot properly and
  the ROM check in the operator menu returns OK (small exception: Thrill Drive 3 doesn't have a ROM check function but does have a
  data check during boot). However, because these are not HDD dumps straight from a real machine, I have marked them as `BAD_DUMP`
  so they can be replaced in the future if someone has the means to make proper dumps from a real machine. Likewise, the dongle
  files are generated using custom tools so they're marked as `BAD_DUMP` in case someone can replace them with real dongles dumps,
  but the dongle payload is understood and has been verified working against a real hardware. The `ps2_nvram` and `ps2_hdd_id` files
  *do* come from a real Python 2 machine but will need to be replaced if an HDD dump is replaced.
The BIOS dumped from a real Python 2 hash matches the `ps2-0190j-20030822.bin` "SCPH-50000 (Version 5.0 08/22/03 J)" BIOS already
  included in the `sony/ps2sony.cpp` driver so that file has been copied as-is. The dump is credited to Guru in the comments of
  `sony/ps2sony.cpp`, so credits to Guru for the BIOS.
Input bits have been roughly documented based on my research in emulating the Python 2 USB I/O board.

10262: Improve accuracy of pokey emulation. [ElectricMagic]
The implementation changes come from the A7800 project.
Here's a sample from the homebrew Atari 7800 game "E.X.O.", whose soundtrack relies on accurate Pokey behavior. Listen especially
  from 14 seconds onwards.
MAME 246.
MAME with changes.

10263: Correct the English translations of Monon Color games [Qiangong2]
A QoL fix rather than anything else
4+ years ago, when I originally translated them, 赛尔号 didn't have an English name. That has changed since then. I overlooked Roco
  Kingdom as well, so that has been fixed.
The capitalization issues were also bugging me, so I fixed those.
I didn't touch the software names as I was unsure if changes would be needed or not.

10265: Corrected Magic Card game names [Paul-Arnold]
TeamEurope pointed out that some of the Magic Card game names were incorrect, these have now been fixed.
Now the names are correct some of the romset names are obviously wrong.
Could someone give me guidance on what the romset names should be please as I'm really not sure.
For the Magic Card games there is the following (grouped together for easier reading)
magicard	"Magic Card (v2.01)"
magicarda	"Magic Card (v1.5 17.12.93, set 1)"
magicardb	"Magic Card (v1.5 17.12.93, set 2)"
magicarde	"Magic Card Export 94 (v2.11a, set 1)"
magicardea	"Magic Card Export 94 (v2.11a, set 2)"
magicardf	"Magic Card Export 94 (V2.11a, set 3)"
magicardeb	"Magic Card Export 94 (v2.09a)"
magicardec	"Magic Card III Jackpot (V4.01 6/98)"
magicardj	"Magic Card III Jackpot (V4.01 7/98)"
unkte06	"Magic Card (v1.10 14.09.94)"
magicardw	"Magic Card (v1.2 200/93, set 1)"
unkpkr_w	"Magic Card (v1.2 200/93, set 2)"
unkpkr_w and unkte06 are obviously wrong but what to name to ?
Should romsets such as magiarde/ea/f all be related now ? which possibly makes magicardec wrong ? Not sure about magicardeb either.
Possibly magicarda/b should be better related ?
Guidance very much needed on this please

10266: raiden.cpp: Document the configuration bytes, convert comments to cpp-style [einstein95]
Also documented the values of 0x1fffd and 0x1fffe in the sets which didn't have them. I'm unsure whether to actually document them,
  as the value after decryption changes for some sets.

This is a stopgap solution until #10163 is resolved.

10273: Add FDOS disk format for the SWTPC 6800 [n6il]
The FDOS Operating System was released by SWTPC in 1977 along with the
MF-68 Mini Disk System and was superceeded by FLEX a few months later.
This change adds support to boot FDOS on the SWTPC 6800 machine in MAME
using a specific disk image (FDOSMPS.DSK) from deramp.com (Mike Douglas)
and can also read/write the other available disk images.

10274: Added support for building on OpenBSD/arm64. [fcambus]

10275: ksys573: Add 811jaa02 audio CD for drmna [987123879113]
This isn't exactly a new clone but just a new dump for an existing game so I wasn't sure how to write the commit message for the
  readme. Please credit this dump to Taro.
This PR is for the proper audio CD for the Japanese-only release of Drummania + also cleared up some confusion about the b02 disc.
  The b02 disc is the all-region version. The JAD disc is a real upgrade disc and not a bootleg.
From a brief comparison, it appears that the big difference between the audio CD for a02 and b02 is there is an extra track at the
  end of b02 that has the practice track in English. The track ordering seem to be otherwise the same.

10276: kpython2: Add Dance 86.4 Funky Radio Station [987123879113]
This completes the Python 2 library as far as having at least one version of every game on the platform. The only thing left is any
  unknown/undumped regional variants (English version of Thrill Drive 3?) and undumped datecodes/updates (GFDM V initial release,
  and any other online updates).

10277: kpython2: Fix dongle data for dance864 [987123879113]
The dongle tool I use writes the 8 byte serial before the 32 byte payload but the format I'm trying to keep consistent with in MAME
  (Viper's existing dongle dumps of the same chip type) have the 32 byte payload before the 8 byte serial. The contents of each
  section is still the same, just shuffled around now. The previous Python 2 dongle files were reordered already to follow the Viper
  driver ordering but I forgot to reorder these when submitting the previous PR. Sorry.

-ui/icorender.cpp: Revert initialisations that can hide real bugs. [Vas Crabb]
 * MSVC isn't smart enough to detect that these can only be used after being assigned while clang and GCC can work it out fine.
    Initialising them to zero at declaration has the potential to mask real bugs if some code path tries to use them without
    assigning them.  Code flow analysis (e.g. Coverity) or memory analysers (e.g. valgrind or Purify) won't pick up on the buggy
    path because the variable will technically be initialised.
 * MSVC is problematic when it comes to warnings about uninitialised variables in general.  Unfortunately MSVC has no option to
    selectively treat warnings as errors, unlike clang/GCC which have -Wno-error= which we use extensively.  Until Microsoft
    addresses these issues, you'll have to use NOWERROR=1 when building with MSVC.
 * Also, some cleanup.

Sony NET WORK STATION NWS-5000X [Brice Onken]

-Merged some single-platform projects into company projects. [Vas Crabb]
 * Also moved a few things out of skeleton into other places.

New working clones
------------------
B.Rap Boys Special (World, older) [nnap]

-bus: Get rid of some dubious tag manipulation. [Vas Crabb]
 * The implementation details of how the cartridges allocate storage for memory really shouldn't be part of the interface.  Having
    tags in the headers encourages people to depend on these implementation details. This gets rid of it in most of the headers.  A
    few particularly leaky abstractions (bbc/rom, electron/cart, gba, generic, jakks_gamekey, m5) depend on this, so it can't be
    removed in those cases without further refactoring to encapsulate the slot devices better.
 * This doesn't change behaviour, it just mechanically removes stuff from the headers and uses device_t::subtag rather than string
    manipulation on tags.  Most of the cartridge devices shouldn't have rom_alloc member functions at all - the region created by
    the software list loader can be used directly when loading from the software list, and the slot can allocate a region with the
    same tag when loading loose software.  This avoids creating an extra region and copying the data when loading from the software
    list.  See vboy for an example that doesn't allocate a superfluous region.

-tecfri/holeland.cpp, tecfri/sauro.cpp, tecfri/speedbal.cpp: consolidated drivers in single files, minor cleanups [Ivan Vangelista]

-emu/validity.cpp, ui/info.cpp: Base "no sound" check on speaker devices. [Vas Crabb]
 * Currently the speaker device is the only way sound can get to the OSD layer, so its presence or absence determines whether the
    emulated system is capabale of producing sound.  A few systems use chips with sound capability for other purposes (typically I/O
    or video) while leaving the sound outputs disconnected.  These systems should display the notice about the absence of sound
    output.

-nintendo/gb.cpp: A bit of cleanup. [Vas Crabb]
 * Combined driver source files.
 * Split up state classes and got rid of legacy start/reset callback overrides.
 * Use configured banking for GBC RAM (fixes some save state issues, but there could be more lurking).
 * Moved notes about cartridge hardware to more appropriate places.

-chess artwork: fix xml error on white bishop [hap]

-galaxian.cpp: redumped bmxstunts. Confirmed both dumps in MAME come from the same PCB and that one is just bad. Removed the bad
