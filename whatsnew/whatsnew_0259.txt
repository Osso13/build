11430: nscsi: Add SCSI tape device based on SIMH tape image format [mietek]
This commit adds SCSI tape drive support, following the SCSI-2 draft specification, and based on the SIMH tape image format.
This work has been tested mostly with `macii`, `macqd700`, and `macqd800`, using System 7.1.1 Pro and DeskTape 2.0.  Example usage:
    mame macii mac711 -ramsize 8m -nothrottle -scsi:5 tape
CC @galibert

## Limitations
We support all commands defined as mandatory for sequential devices by the SCSI-2 draft specification, and some commands defined as
  optional.
We self-identify in response to `INQUIRY` as `MAME SCSI tape drive 1.0`.  Some emulated software may require other vendor, product,
  and revision values.
We only pretend to support `PREVENT`/`ALLOW MEDIUM REMOVAL`, since the MAME UI does not support preventing the user from removing
  tape images.  Tape images should be unmounted in the guest OS before being removed by the user to avoid odd guest OS behavior.
We only pretend to support `RESERVE`/`RELEASE UNIT`, since MAME does not support multiple initiators.
Our handling of `MODE SELECT` and `MODE SENSE` is minimal, and may need to be extended in order to support additional emulated
  software.  In particular, in response to `MODE SENSE`, we only report a zero-length page 0, and a density code of 0 in the block
  descriptor, since the SIMH tape image specification does not include tape density.
We default to a block length of 512 bytes for fixed-length blocks.  The block length can be changed with `MODE SELECT` up to 16MB.
  Variable-length blocks are supported up to the same block length limit.
We default to mounting tape images for reading and writing.  Read-only mounting is accomplished by ensuring the tape image file is
  write-protected, for example with `chmod -w`.
The medium size is defined by the size of the tape image file.  We assume the early-warning region starts at 32KB from
  end-of-medium, instead of the 10ft required by ANSI, since the SIMH tape image specification does not include tape length.
We support creating blank tape images from within MAME, and default to a medium size of 60MB, since the MAME UI does not support
  specifying creation parameters.  Any file consisting of a sequence of `0xFF` bytes is acceptable as a blank tape image file.
We support filemarks, but not setmarks, because setmarks are not defined by the SIMH tape image specification. We do not support
  spacing over sequential filemarks, since it is defined as optional by the SCSI-2 draft specification, and we do not have a good
  way to test any filemark-related functionality.
Our handling of the SIMH tape image format conforms to the standard format, as defined by the SIMH specification, but we do not
  support seeking through erase gaps.  In other words, any data blocks following an erase gap in a tape image are inaccessible.
## Changes to nscsi
`nscsi_bus.h` only provided a few SCSI Additional Sense Codes as 8-bit `SK_ASC_...` constants.  We provide all SCSI Additional Sense
  Codes and SCSI Additional Sense Code Qualifiers defined by the SCSI-2 draft specification (with SCSI-3 additions) as 16-bit
  `SKC_...` constants, to match their actual usage.
We augment `nscsi_full_device::sense` with the more expressive `nscsi_full_device::set_sense_data` and associated helpers.
We change the minimum length of response to `REQUEST SENSE` from 4 to 18 in `nscsi_full_device`, as this seems correct.
## Future work
In `nscsi_full_device`, `nscsi_harddisk_device`, and `nscsi_cdrom_device`:
- Replace uses of `nscsi_full_device::sense` with appropriate helpers.
- Reject commands other than `INQUIRY` and `REQUEST SENSE` that are addressed to LUNs other than 0.
In `nscsi_harddisk_device` and `nscsi_cdrom_device`:
- Subtract 1 from the mode data length in response to `MODE SENSE`.
In `nscsi_harddisk_device`:
- Correct `scsi_put_data` to stop treating incoming `MODE SELECT` data as `WRITE` data, which could lead to data loss in unlikely
  circumstances.

11500: sh2: Refactor code into SH2 base CPU class + separate CPU devices [987123879113]
sh2.cpp doesn't have separation between the SH-2 CPU core code and the on-chip peripherals, so I separated the core code to make
  adding new SH-2 CPUs easier.
This is only a draft PR for now as I haven't done a lot of testing to make sure nothing is broken, but I would like feedback on the
  overall refactoring work if there's something noticeably wrong with how I'm going about this refactor.
I split off sh2.cpp/sh2comn.cpp into separate CPU devices with non-generic names into their own separate files, and tried to make
  some small refactoring changes to allow each individual CPU to handle things like IRQs in their own way as needed (like the vector
  mode flag requirement for only SH7604) but have otherwise tried to keep the actual logic the same. Unused variables and defines
  and such were deleted when found for a small bit of cleanup. I also tried to credit authors in the headers for the separated CPU
  cores when they were obvious but the code dates back pre-git so I gave up for now. Feel free to let me know if someone should or
  shouldn't be included in any of the specific files.
What inspired this refactor/what I'm trying to fix with this refactor: While trying to implement a SH-2 CPU with a completely
  different set of non-matching peripherals, I quickly ran into many issues such as clashing peripheral variable names (of different
  type sizes especially), `device_start` registering a bunch of save items that would never be used (and also causing name
  collisions), creation of unnecessary timers, unnecessary callbacks, issues with the address mask used for the existing SH-2 cores
  (for example it's impossible to set up a DMA to read data into a on-chip serial port which is a use case I was seeing in my CPU
  core, due to the source/dest addresses being masked and in general all reads/writes mask using `SH12_AM`), vector mode/m_vecmd not
  being required in the exception handler, etc.

11505: apple/apple3_m.cpp: Added cpu clock changing for video raster scanning [robjustice]
This updated is based on the schematic and logic analyser traces to confirm behavior on real hardware. The CPU speed is down
  changing to 1MHz when reading the video memory, and then back to 2MHz during the blanking periods. The video screen can also be
  turned off, resulting in 2MHz speed running full time.
The other thing impacting the CPU speed is slowdowns for dram refresh cycles. There is a logic rom that takes input from the video
  counters to generate the refresh signal, it's not a simple asymmetric clock signal. I have used an average frequency measured from
  a logic analyser trace for now for the resultant higher clock speed.
With these changes in, the game Atomic Defence speech is very close in sound now to the real hardware. Previously it was running
  much faster in MAME. And the smooth scrolling intro is scrolling at the same rate now.

11509: Tidied up the Amstrad Action covertapes, promoted amsac004 to working status [ICEknigh7]
Added the actual titles that these covertapes were given and tidied up their descriptions in general.
Added "Future Publishing" as publisher.
Promoted `amsac004` to working status (others I tested still froze at some point, so might not be worth testing further until the
  core gets some fixes).

11512: ppc: Don't overwrite RA in lmw instruction [987123879113]
Findings around this can be found here: https://github.com/mamedev/mame/commit/62f77513f1a4297dd15971f8909e0922918a53cc#r125639616
For 4xx series and 601 this change will skip over the register update which is what the CPU manuals says should happen. For any
  other flavor it will raise an illegal instruction exception since the behavior isn't defined but it does state it's an invalid
  form.
Only known game so far to rely on this functionality is `tropchnc` which explodes early on in boot process without this fix.

11513: heathkit/h89.cpp: add optional CPU speed upgrade modifications [mgarlanger]
Several companies offered CPU speed upgrades for the H89. These used a bit in the GPP to toggle between the standard 2.048 MHz speed
  and the upgraded speeds. Upgrades at least to 6 MHz were available.
Options for 4 MHz and 6 MHz were added.
Also updated how changes in GPP are detected.
Set the interrupt controller slot device to a "fixed" slot, to avoid users breaking the H89 by changing it. Once additional add-on
  boards are available and the soft-sectored controller is made into a slot device itself, the program will be able to properly set
  the interrupt controller based on what boards are installed.

11514: konami/twin16.cpp: Dumped priority PROM for The Final Round/Hard Puncher [jotego]

11521: Fix mingw/arm64 build issues [invertego]
I recently tried building MAME for Windows/arm64 with clang and mingw and it almost just worked, given the right build options.
  These are fixes for the couple of build issues I encountered.
These changes were tested by compiling natively with msys2/clangarm64 and also by cross-compiling with llvm-mingw. I booted a
  handful of machines without issue.
The crash diagnostic code is tested and working as well. Example:
```

11533: namco/namcos12: redump of bad ROM for Kart Duel [Phil Bennett] [987123879113]
Previously this game would crash to a blue screen if you selected "race" mode, just before you entered the car selection screen. The
  crashing no longer happens after a new redump from Phil. The game still needs the network PCB emulated to fix the frame rate
  hitching issue that happens when it tries to communicate with the network PCB, so it still can't be promoted to working.

11534: heathkit/tlb.cpp: Fix GP-19 graphics mode display [mgarlanger]

```

11540: capcom/cps2.cpp: Support for CPS2 debug DIP switches [drojaazu]
Adds support for the debugging DIP switches which are referenced in many CPS2 games and which apparently existed on dev boards
  thanks to images that have surfaced. Implemented as a machine configuration.
A write-up detailing the switches is posted here:
https://sudden-desu.net/entry/cps2-debug-switches-and-the-games-that-love-them
Note that in the article, I mentioned deciding against submitting a PR as it should technically be a whole new driver as it is
  different hardware, but given a conversation with @MooglyGuy on twitter, I've decided to go ahead and let the devs decide if it
  should be accepted.

11547: osd/sdl: Fixed interpretation of result of SDL_GetDesktopDisplayMode [Davidian1024]
SDL_GetDesktopDisplayMode returns 0 on success.  The current logic seems to assume that it returns true on success.  Updated the
  logic so that the lines printing the desktop mode and current display mode info can be reached.

When I redumped the raflesiau, the sound CPU "epr-7420.3" matched the CRC of "epr-7420.120".
(ic3 is probably a bad dump)

11556: hh_tms1k.cpp: Updated MCU list notes [SomeRandomGuyIdk]

11558: namco/namcos12: Add CDXA board emulation [987123879113]
This PR includes all of the code required to make `truckk` on Namco System 12 playable. Also adds a new machine `ujlnow`.
Small overview of the various changes here since it wraps multiple things into this one PR:
- Added SH7014 CPU device: Not feature complete. I only focused on the features I could test so there's a lot that isn't implemented
  still. I tried to add TODOs where I remembered not implementing something.
- Added icd2061a (IC Designs 2061A Dual Programmable Graphics Clock Generator). Used to generate clock used for audio on the CDXA
  PCB.
- Added ic78836m (Sanyo LC78836M Digital Audio 16-bit D/A Converter). INITB, D/N, and digital filters not implemented but the rest
  should be working.
- psx/dma: Added a small delay to PIO DMA reads for the specific case where `n_channelcontrol` is 0x01000000. The DMA instantly
  ending caused code to be executed out of the intended order resulting in an impossible state making the code get stuck in an
  infinite loop waiting for the DMA to finish. The game code sets up the PSX DMA registers before initializing its own internal DMA
  state flags, and then the DMA finished callback gets called immediately after before the rest of the internal DMA state flags
  could be fully initialized, causing the DMA finished flag to be wiped when it returned back to the normal code path. This change
  also fixes `ptblank2` and `gunbarl` so the old DMA 5 game code patch hack was removed.
- t10mmc: Added T10SBC_CMD_SEEK_10 which is used by `truckk` and expects to see the `IDE_STATUS_DSC` flag or else it gets stuck in
  an infinite loop, + small regression bug fix in T10MMC_CMD_READ_CD.
CDXA PCB pics for documentation thanks to Phil Bennett: https://imgur.com/a/GRnxZhm
I gave all Namco System 12 a quick boot into gameplay, and tried out some other PSX-based games (namcos10, ksys573, konamigq,
  konamigv) just to make sure nothing was broken from any of these changes.

11560: konami/djmain.cpp: Add Beatstage Complete Mix (Ver KA-B) [DeepSeaSqueeze]
This is the Korean version of Beatmania Complete Mix. The main differences are that it only runs on International DJ Main boards,
  the rebranding to Beatstage, the game being in English and having a few songs removed compared to what's in the JA-A, JA-B and
  AA-C releases.
I've sent over the dump provided by Lemony Vengeance to the contact email.
If possible, in the event that this gets merged I'd like to request that this be credited in the changelog as 
`[Lemony Vengeance, Phil B., DeepSeaSqueeze]`

11563: t10mmc: Fix reading user data from mode 1 tracks using T10MMC_CMD_READ_CD [987123879113]
Split off from previous PR (https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/11558#pullrequestreview-1636339911) because this regression needs
  to be fixed regardless of that PR.
The code reads CD_TRACK_MODE1 using CD_TRACK_MODE1_RAW because the CD-ROM code can generate a usable 16-byte header for non-raw
  tracks without the header. I forgot that when implementing the buffer_offset stuff so it's returning 16 bytes of header when user
  data is requested.  This PR fixes `taiko6` not loading currently.
