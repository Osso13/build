9286: qx10: add multifont option card [brijohn]
This adds supports for emulation of the QX-10 multifont card. It is still missing the font ROMs, but the actual emulation of the
  card works fine. The emulation is based of reading the schematics and documenation that is available online. If the missing font
  roms are ever dumped the emulation should just work. I tested this using mfont from the cpm221m1.td0 boot disk and a fake font rom
  file I created using an existing bitmap bdf font. When running mfont it is correctly reading and displaying the bdf font from the
  fake rom file.

9322: luaengine: make setting analog values user friendly [vadosnaprimer]
Made setting analog values user friendly.
Exposed adjusted min/max values. Together with defvalue, they can be used to check in-game range of available analog values to send.
Previously you had to send raw value between -65535 and 65535 which would then be normalized depending on machine specifics. You
  could read the normalized value from the analog port, but you couldn't send normalized values in, only raw. Since raw values don't
  directly mean anything specific in-game, you had to use trial and error to figure out the range of values that do anything at all.
  In order to work around those gaps in effectiveness, you'd have to normalize the values yourself on the lua side, and not all
  relevant factors were exposed (and normalization is a mess anyway).
This commit results in a slight change in the lua API: effective analog input values will be limited to field's min/max, and will
  get clamped. They get read from the field until you clear the override. Internals of how `analog_field` calculates things is
  unaffected.

9340: docs: Fixed a couple errors in the Technical Specifications. [0kmg]

9341: Added dmovt opcode to i960 cpu [drojaazu]
Primarily added dmovt opcode to prevent occasional crashes in VF2 (and likely other Model 2 games) when in debug mode, as outlined
  here:
https://mametesters.org/view.php?id=7800
Also added daddc/dsubc to round out the decimal opcodes. Code for these is based on the existing addc/subc code. There is a little
  confusion on these, as the newer i960 manual  seems to imply these should work with ASCII coded decimals, like dmovt does.
  However, the older 80960 manual indicates they should work with BCD values. I have implemented the BCD 4 bit versions from the
  older manual as it is more explicit on what effects the opcodes should have on the CPU status.

9343: photoply.cpp: Add recovery discs for Photo Play 2001 [jordigahan, ClawGrip] [clawgrip]

9348: r4000.cpp: Set TLB global bit in EntryLo0/1 on TLBR instruction [briceonk]
Per the MIPS R4000/R4400 User's Manual, the G bit should be written into both EntryLo0 and EntryLo1 when a TLBR instruction is
  executed. Sony NEWS-OS 4.2.1aRD expects this bit to be set if it writes it into the TLB when it reads information back out. This
  is something mips3 has.

9367: famibox.cpp: Added verified cartridges, removed nonexistent cartridges. [0kmg]

9369: 68k: support for external MMU bus error instruction restart [agentbooth]
For review -- this is a proposed fix to address #9170 - suggested for @rb6502 to review. Also of interest to @pmackinlay 
Intended use:
`m_maincpu->set_emmu_enable(1);` called from machine_reset()
When page fault occurs desiring instruction restart, call:
`m_maincpu->set_buserror_details(fault_addr, rw, m_maincpu->get_fc(), true);`
`m_mmu_tmp_buserror_occurred` is set and then detected in execute_run()
If non-instruction restart bus errors are needed, the existing method can be used:
```
m_maincpu->set_input_line(M68K_LINE_BUSERROR, ASSERT_LINE);
m_maincpu->set_input_line(M68K_LINE_BUSERROR, CLEAR_LINE);
```
I also added setting of fault address in the 68010 and 68070 stack frames as this was not supported, but is for some other stack
  frames. Likewise also added rw and fc setting in 68010 special status word.

9370: Add TMS9995 Breadboard driver to evmbug.cpp [cpswan]
Driver for Stuart Conner's TMS9995 Breadboard system supporting the full selection of ROMs
Also changed ROM config for the underlying TMAM6095 system as it uses a 4K ROM for u8 as and a 2K for u9.
I can run HELLO WORLD on the TMAM6095, so removed MACHINE_NOT_WORKING

9378: cpu/i960: Added cycle count adjustment for dmovt instruction [drojaazu]
Added the cycle count adjustment that @cuavas pointed out was missing from previous PR #9341 .

9379: New WORKING software list additions [clawgrip]
----------------------------------------
vsmilem_cart.xml:
  Campanilla (Spain) [TeamEurope, ICEknight, ClawGrip]

9380: Add Kick & Kick (GNA36) ver. EAA [Shizmob]

9381: taito_l.cpp:  correct bonus life DIP switch for raimais, raimaisj, raimaisjo (MT08244) [scoomby]

9382: alpha68k_n: correct audio clock for sstingry [negunma]

9384: galaxian.cpp: correct DIP switches for spacempr (MT08245) [scoomby]

9386: playch10.cpp: Replaced RP5H01 rom in prototype dumps. [0kmg]

9388: k007232.cpp: Fix frequency bits, Add notes [cam900]
reference: https://github.com/furrtek/VGChips/tree/master/Konami/007232 (based on reverse engineering)

9389: k005289.cpp: Minor cleanups, Use struct for voices [cam900]

9391: namco_163.cpp: Fix side effects issue in reading [cam900]

9392: pang3b4 and pang3b5 [janniz]
 This bootleg uses a bootlegged B board nearly identical to that used in sf2ceblp.
     - Board-C is an hacked 88622-C-5 with an unusual CPS-B-12 and clearly it's not its C-board because 
       code analisys led to identify the CPS_B_21_DEF as the right configuration.
      - 28 pin DIP component @F8, probably a PIC16C55/7 looking the pinout (VCC on pin2, GND on pin 4, ...)
   The program code is almost the same as of pang3b with some minor, yet interesting, hacks:
      - Dip switch use for board configuration (code@ 0x000300, 0xe0000) instead of a serial EPROM
      - Removed freeze from dip switch (code@ 020B74)
      - Some code to handle the PIC (protection?). 
        Read and write to addresses 0x5762b0 and 0x57a2b0 occurs in the code but the return value is never really used (nop or bra
  skips relevant parts) and so seems that the PIC protection is ineffective.
      - Read and write to port 0x80017a (EEPROM in pang3) still are present in the code, but are filtered by the PAL16V8 @ E13
      
ROM and CPLD dumps sent to mamedev

9393: famibox.cpp: Added some input control bits. [0kmg]
- Joypads now swap depending on which one hit start on game select menu.
- Controller inputs ignored during attract mode before inserting coin.
- Minor cleanups of cart switching.

9396: fmtowns_flop_orig.xml: 5 new dumps [rzero9]

------------------
beatmania complete MIX (ver JA-C) [Taro]

9399: ksys573: Implement I/O for Kick & Kick [windyfairy, Shiz] [987123879113]
This implements the I/O for the newly added game Kick & Kick. With the I/O board implemented, the game is playable from start to
  finish without any noticeable issues so I removed the `MACHINE_NOT_WORKING` flag. Having said that, while the game works, the
  controls are unintuitive when played as key binds in MAME. The order and the speed that you trigger the sensors is important. I've
  found the order that works best is front sensor -> horizontal sensor -> vertical sensor.

9400: famibox.cpp: Fixed build error. [0kmg]

9401: -bgfx: LUT and texture-loading fixes. [MooglyGuy]
- bgfx: Added lut-default.png and INI defaults. Fixes LUT-effect crash with default settings. Fixed external texture loading,
  restoring HQx filters and others. [Ryan Holtz]

9402: djmain: Fix parenting for bmcompmxb [987123879113]
Fix for PR #9398: `bmcompmxb` was supposed to be a child of `bmcompmx` but I forgot to add the appropriate parent parameter.

9403: nes.xml: Added seven prototypes. [0kmg]

9410: More BGFX stability improvements (missing files + multi-window) [MooglyGuy]
- bgfx: Improved stability when encountering missing files, and improved multi-window stability. [Ryan Holtz]

9411: famibox.xml: Initial software list. [0kmg]
I forgot to add a credits list of those who provided dumps and/or info:
  [Fiskbit, ICEknigh7, j4m13c0, joey4, kmg, Marionova64, Patnukem, RetroGE, togemet2]

9412: Adding 'FORMATS["COCO_RAWDSK"] = true' to mess.lua [npwoods]
I was advised that my recent change broke the build and this fixes it.  Please scrutinize, as I have not ran a full build yet.

9415: photoply.cpp: Add security dongle MCU dumps for 'photoply99sp' [Caps0ff, jordigahan, ClawGrip] [clawgrip]
Four dongles has been dumped, finding different mixes of MCU programs and EEPROM ROMs, making not much sense with the "rev" sticker
  present on each one.

9416: fmtowns_flop_orig.xml: add redumped aressh4m [cyo.the.vile] [rzero9]
This replaces the system disk for A Ressha de Ikou IV Map Construction + Power-Up Kit. Turns out this disk was protected (the other
  two are not), but it went unnoticed because the previous dump was made with a simple "dd" command that somehow didn't report any
  errors. This image comes from a flux-level dump and passes the protection check.
I also found out that you can run these disks directly instead of installing them to HDD, so I have updated the usage notes.

9417: bus/nes_ctrl: Split zapper sensor off as a reusable device. [0kmg]

9418: Minitel 2 : Modem and serial port support [ovalenti]
This PR makes it possible to use the emulated minitel as if it was connected using its modem or serial line.
Since the original purpose of this device is to serve as a modem terminal, it is now possible to have an interaction with a real
  server.

9419: Lua engine: Enable checks for debug builds, kill sol::buffer [cuavas]
This does two things: enables all of Sol’s safety checks in debug builds, and replaces the `sol::buffer` class with another helper
  for using Lua string buffers.
The first change is simpler.  It means that for debug builds, you get somewhat helpful error messages when you do something like
  using `.` instead of `:` when calling instance member function rather than MAME just crashing twenty levels inside Sol (@galibert
  might appreciate this).  Of course, this does cost performance in debug builds.  However, this can’t be done without doing
  something about `sol::buffer` (see MT08242), which brings us to the second change.
The point of `sol::buffer` was to allow returning a Lua string from C++ without needing the copy you’d get if you return a
  std::string object, as this could be quite significant when doing something like reading a file into memory.  However, the
  implementation was dangerous, particularly easy to result in a memory leak, and didn’t allow building the Lua string piecemeal if
  you want to do that.  Lua buffers do require some care to use, as they put multiple things on the stack, so all stack operations
  need to be balanced when using them.  This means it’s not a great idea to hide the implementation details too much, lest
  developers forget they’re playing with fire.
The replacement for `sol::buffer` allows building a string piecemeal before finalising the result on the stack.  Currently only
  prepare/add operations are exposed, but other operations supported by Lua buffers would be easy to add if desirable.  I’m using
  `sol::stack::pop` to get the result in a form that can be returned back to Sol without resorting to using raw Lua functions.  I
  *think* it doesn’t need to copy the finalised string, but if it does, please tell me.

9452: docs: Fixed a copy/paste typo in the Technical Specifications. [0kmg]

9453: Make Lua errors in bootstrap scripts fatal [cuavas]
* Made auto-boot script errors and plugin bootstrap errors fatal.
* Run auto-boot scripts in a sandbox.  Globals can be accessed, but not set.  The sandbox is cleared on hard reset, but not on soft
  reset.
* Added a (hopefully) useful to string metafunction to device_t that shows the short name and tag.
* Fixed some issues in plugins that surface when strict type checking is enabled, as this means numbers and nil are not
  automatically converted to strings.  Plugins should be tested with debug builds to check for this.
* Changed some more function bindings to use set_function to avoid issues related to ThePhD/sol2#608, and got rid of some
  unnecessary lambda captures.
The first change is something @galibert requested.  This involved exposing some lower-evel helpers on the Lua engine class.

9456: qx10: Implement floppy motor on timer [brijohn]
This commit fixes the floppy motor on signal so that it actually turns off after a set amount of time as per the original hardware.
The timer uses a 12 bit counter with the MSB being used as the motor on signal. When it is zero the floppy motor is turned on and
  when it goes to 1 the motor turns off. This counter is driven by the NOR of the rtc's square wave generator and the MSB of the
  counter.  When IO port 30 is written to the counter is reset to zero enabling the motor and will count until the MSB goes high at
  which point the counter is halted and the motor turns off.

9461: PC incrementation bug on TRAPcc rare instructions [jotd666]
Detected on old UAE and musashi codes, and also present here.
Those instructions are 68020+ only rarely used so I suppose that it went undetected for a long time
For example TRAPT followed by an argument is used in xdAda cross compiler for VMS and the argument is the type of Ada exception.
  Since PC was incremented after the exception handler has been called, the PC pushed on the stack is wrong, and since the exception
  handling code uses that information to get the TRAP argument, the wrong exception type is read and the program fails.
Incrementing the PC before calling the handler fixes the issue. The same problem happens on several TRAP instructions.
It was also fixed in WinUAE 4.4 too (Toni found the issue with his cputester, I found the issue by debugging the code)
PS: sorry about all the commits. I made a mess at first when generating the c++ code with the python script, then didn't check the
  indentation. Should be ok now.

 * Previously you had to send a normalised value between -65535 and 65535 which would be scaled depending on machine specifics.  You
    could read the scaled value from the port, but you couldn't send scaled values in.  This allows scripts to set scaled values as
    seen by the machine.

    what was causing problems with symbol table read_memory/write_memory.  (They aren't really essential - you can do the same thing
    with the address space object itself, but they're easier to parameterise.)

 * Made auto-boot script errors and plugin bootstrap errors fatal.

    reset.
 * Added (hopefully) useful to string metafunctions to device_t and address space that show short names and tags.
 * Fixed issues in plugins that surface when strict type checking is enabled, as this means numbers and nil are not automatically
    converted to strings.  Plugins should be tested with debug builds to check for this.
 * Made save item read_block raise an error on invalid arguments rather than returning an empty string, and made it use luaL_buffer
    directly rather than using the helper wrapper.
 * Changed some more function bindings to use set_function to avoid issues related to ThePhD/sol2#608, and got rid of some
    unnecessary lambda captures.
