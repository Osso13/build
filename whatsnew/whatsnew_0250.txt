10464: Fix FDC Busy bit for overlapped commands [pnp2084]
A proposed fix for https://mametesters.org/view.php?id=8464
The problem here is that the end of the previous command clears the BSY status bit which makes it appear to system code that the
  second command has completed (when it has not).
The bug report has files to demonstrate the problem on a TRS-80 Model I emulation.
The "next_command_time.is_zero() || next_command_time.is_never()" is awkward but both conditions seem necessary.

10479: Mark new bosco parent set PROMs as good [neSneSgB]
I was going to dump this version a few months ago because I got a PCB with it, but I forgot about it until now. Anyways, I can
  verify that the PROMs are the same as on the other revisions. The only thing of note is that BOS1-3 and BOS1-4 on my PCB have
  swapped labels, but the data was correct for the board location. Considering that my BOS1-6 also has an upside label, I am going
  to assume that it was just a label mistake.

10483: Don't force lower samplerate for `-sound none` [vadosnaprimer]
The user can still lower it if needed (probably rare these days?), but in case it was needed to be higher, there was no way to
  increase it.
When using lua instead of OSD to obtain samples, we don't need sound output, but we need decent samplerate.

10530: Remove reference to incorrect Yamaha TX81Z ROM image [ajxs]
The Yamaha TX81Z driver references a `tx81z-last-revision.ic15` ROM binary. This is an error.
The TX81Z's most recent firmware version is v1.6 from 1989. The binaries for the various firmware ROMs can be obtained here: _\<link
  removed\>_, as well as Yamaha's official documentation of changes: https://mgregory22.me/tx81z/files/TX81Z_Service_News.pdf
A version of the erroneous `tx81z-last-revision.ic15` ROM file (with the correct hash) can be found here: _\<link removed\>_. Doing
  a diff between this file and the v1.6 ROM shows the only thing that has changed is the version string. There are no functional
  changes.
I'm not sure where this file came from. It's not an official ROM, and does not appear to be of any practical use. I've removed the
  reference from the driver file.

Source of measurements --> https://github.com/MikeS11/Arcade-Sonson_MiSTer/issues/1#issuecomment-1312089702
The value originally set must have been a typo, according to @kold669 (aka Corrado Tomaselli who is credited in the original change
  made back in 0.156). The original PCB alternates between 55.37Hz and 55.43Hz and it is Corrado's suggestion to run it at 55.40Hz.

Altered Space - A 3-D Alien Adventure (USA, prototype, 19910215) [SteelGeneral, Forest of Illusion]
I've marked this as partial because all of its clones are marked partial. I'm not sure if/when there are issues with MAME's
  emulation for this game. There's this page which describes issues related to the edge-triggered STAT IRQ. MAME doesn't have the
  glitches in the screenshot shown there, so maybe things are all good? Or maybe there are yet more subtle issues for this title?
  I'll leave it to somebody more knowledgeable about the GB drivers to say whether the "partial" flags can be removed here.

10546: newport: Split out iterator setup stage [FlyGoat]
In REX3, iterator setup should be a dedicated operation that is only execuated if
a). A Draw command is execuated with DoSetup at DRAWMODE0 set or
b). A host write is issued to SETUP register
At setup stage REX3 will calcuate quadrant for a block or span drawcall or octant together with some Bresenham parameters for a line
  drawcall.
Linux newport_con driver is rely on this behavior to use quadrant calculated by previous draw call to render characters.

10557: jvshost: Fix size of encoded packet with escaped bytes [987123879113]
The size of the encoded packet returned by the `encode` function was off by the number of bytes that were escaped. This issue is
  only seen when a raw packet includes bytes that need to be escaped (0xd0 or 0xe0).
The `add` variable is added to the output `size` variable after the loop but since the `add` variable is directly decremented every
  time a byte is escaped in the loop, the final `size += add` turns into `size += 0`.

10559: hornet: Replace JVS impl with jvs_host device [987123879113]
The JVS code in hornet seems to predate `jvs_host` so I ripped out the old code and replaced it with an equivalent using `jvs_host`
  to allow for hooking up a `jvs_device`-based JVS device as well as get rid of some duplicated logic.
Gradius 4 with the Master Calendar JVS device as well as a stubbed Windy 2 JVS I/O device (identifies as `KONAMI
  CO.,LTD.;Windy2;Ver1.0;Windy2 I/O Ver1.0`) were used for testing.
I also tested gradius4, nbapbp, terabrst, thrilldbu, sscope, sscope2 to make sure they were still booting without a JVS device
  hooked up.

10560: Ensure queue->thread will have at least 1 work_thread_info in it [CasualPokePlayer]
For platforms which do not support threads (i.e. emuscripten), queue->thread might not have any work_thread_info's added to it. This
  is bad as osd_work_item_queue_multiple will access queue->thread[0] when queue->threads == 0, and subsequently crash as the queue
  has no items in it.

10578: konami/hornet.cpp: Added x76 security chip, and added new regional variants of games [987123879113]
- x76 security chip which is used by Gradius 4 and NBA Play By Play has been implemented.
  - Fixes NBA Play By Play showing as "Ver. ***" and the language changes as expected based on region now (`nbapbp` claims to be
  Japanese but would boot as a default region and became English instead). On boot this game will always read a chunk from the
  security EEPROM and write it to the top of the RTC data and contains the region information.
- Fixed Silent Scope Voodoo 2 configuration not working as intended. The k033906 had a fixed PCI ID for a Voodoo 1 so games thought
  they were using a Voodoo 1 even when using the Voodoo 2 configuration. Silent Scope 1/2 quick crashed with the Voodoo 2
  configuration due to an unimplemented register which was also implemented in this PR.
- The Silent Scope 2 revision C set had a "931a04.16t" file which only had 2 bytes different from every other set, and between those
  only 1 bit is different in each of the 2 bytes. I suspect it's a bad dump but I have no way to verify so I added a comment about
  it. The game will boot with either of the available dumps so it's not a game breaker.
Every game in the Hornet driver, including all regional variants and hardware configurations, has been tested to make sure they boot
  to at least the title screen using the region specified. The only game that does not boot is the A revision set for Teraburst for
  which I added some information about the issue and a hack to skip the problem code for whoever tries to fix that in the future.
-------
Edit: Made up the full change log for this PR. I did not change the working/not working tags for any games so Gradius IV and NBA
  Play By Play retain their previous working status. I am not the original dumper of the actual game ROMs so I don't care if I'm
  credited for these or not.

10580: machine/upd71071.cpp: initialize variables, prevents random HDD failures in fmtowns [rzero9]
For some time I've noticed that the hard drives were occasionally (randomly) not working on startup in the FM Towns machines, which
  usually points to something using uninitialized variables. After tracing it with Valgrind it seems the issue is in the uPD71071
  DMA controller.
I have tested the driver with these changes and in about 30 tries it hasn't failed at all (it didn't take more than 3 or 4 before),
  so I'm pretty confident that it's working correctly now.

This is the first driver I've implemented. If there are any issues with how I've structured the code, or any extra documentation
  required, please let me know, and I'll be happy to correct the issues.
If I understand it correctly, I need to email the required ROM image to the MAME developers. If someone could instruct me where to
  send that, I'm happy to do so.

As per the PPC403 CPU manual, SerClk is supposed to be an external clock and can only be up to half of SysClk, and SysClk should be
  the actual system clock speed.
!image
The hardcoded 33333333 (system clock) and 3686400 (serial clock) constants have existed for longer than I can see in the Git history
  (pre-0.121) so I don't have more context for those specific values.
https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blame/7b77f1218624ea26dbb2efd85a19f795f5d4e02e/src/emu/cpu/powerpc/ppc403.c#L625-L629
I tested with a few random Konami Hornet, Konami Cobra, and Konami Firebeat games and everything seems to be working as well as
  before, and a fatal error with Hornet games when frequently polling for inputs on the JVS I/O has been fixed (commented in code).
  The fatal error does not affect any games currently but will occur when a JVS I/O device is hooked up as required for 4 player
  inputs in NBA Play By Play.

10589: nintendo/vsnes.cpp: Fill in missing Dora DIP settings. [0kmg]

10591: konami/hornet.cpp: Fix 4 player cabinet type in NBA Play By Play [987123879113]
Windy 2 JVS I/O device has been tested in NBA Play By Play on Konami Hornet and Fighting Wu-Shu 2nd! on Konami Cobra hardware.
The panel configuration is normally determined by the DIPSW8 on the I/O PCB but I found the games can be picky about the minimum
  number of buttons available for it to accept the panel configuration, so I removed the user configurable dipswitch in favor of
  having the driver programmer decide the best panel type for a game to reduce any false reports from bad panel configuration
  settings.
This is the panel layout and dipswitch setting reference from the manual:

-mtu130.cpp: enable additional reset vector, fixes protection failures [Peter Ferrie]

-mps1200.cpp: added dip switch settings [Guru]

-Terra Cresta and later Nichibutsu drivers: Consolidate some common configs down into their own machine_config sections, and reduce
 a lot of code duplication. Also fix audio volume balance to compensate for the fact that the YM3012 Serial DAC for the FM chips
 outputs at half the peak to peak voltage of the R2R DACs, and the YM2203's SSG channels have another, different peak output level
 as well. This also adds filtered sound to Legion, which didn't have it in the previous commit due to the complex configs it had.

 * This reverts commit 922d5b3c81459173ce99970dca0e44825f0a4494.
 * This broke an important use case with MIPS3 address comparisons no longer behaving intutively.
 * It's also another case of a debugger change that wasn't followed through properly, with absolutely no attempt to update the
    internal debugger help or the documentation for the web site.
 * I realise signed maths woud be a useful feature, for the debugger, but it needs to be done in a way that doesn't break important
    use cases.
