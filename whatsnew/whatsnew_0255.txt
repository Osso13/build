11153: MSM5232: Use correct attack/decay time nominal value when certain attack/decay time data is specified [yaei]
MSM5232 determines the attack or decay duration of each note from the lower 3 bits of Attack Time Data(addr $8,$9), or the value
  specified in the lower 4 bits of Decay Time Data(addr $A,$B).
According to the datasheet, when the lower 3 bits of the Attack/Decay Time Data are 0x6 or 0x7, the second bit is ignored and the
  value for 0x4 or 0x5 is used.
The current msm5232 emulation implementation does not take this into account.
For example, with 0xE specified in the Decay Time Data, the decay duration of a note should be 4 seconds, but the current
  implementation decays for 16 seconds.
This commit corrects the Attack/Decay time to be in line with the datasheet when 0x6 or 0x7 is specified for the lower 3 bits of
  Attack/Decay Time Data.

The attached datasheet is the reference.
It is described on p.15-16, 25.

11166: namcos10: Add decrypted Point Blank 3 program code [windyfairy, Guru] [987123879113]
The decrypted program code has been scrambled into the same format that the rest of the NAND data uses and placed into the same
  blocks the encrypted program code occupied. The NAND data read function will passthrough to the unscramble function when a
  decrypter isn't present, so the patched ROM will work as-is without any game specific hacks required in driver. When a decrypter
  is made then it is required to remove the unenc ROM entry or it will try to read the scrambled program code as encrypted program
  code.
~~Cursor could possibly use some offsetting to make it dead center, but using the offset parameter of `PORT_CROSSHAIR` causes the UI
  cursor to just stop working properly for me in macOS for some reason. For example, setting the X offset to a non-0 value causes
  the Y to stop working visually, but in the in-game gun calibration menu I can see that it's still reading the gun values for both
  X and Y. Maybe something to report as a separate issue?~~

11171: Changed logerror stuff in i386 to use granular masking [Luigi30]
At the moment, the cores derived from i386 create megabytes of logerror() debug spew every second when running protected-mode
  applications.
For example, under EMM386, most hardware IRQs will cause a GPF. Since all GPFs are printed by logerror() in i386, that means that
  under normal usage you get thousands and thousands of task gate error GPFs in your error log that don't mean anything.
This sets up a more granular logging system based on LOGMASKED bits to control the output and make it easier to debug systems using
  i386.

11172: dec/vt100.cpp: add setting for phosphor color. [drougge]

11195: konami/firebeat: Update pop'n music to use DVD CHDs + add new clones [987123879113]
Rebuilt DVD CHDs for Firebeat pop'n music by using extractraw and then createdvd. The generated pop'n music 4 DVD CHD matches OG's
  original hash using this method.
Additionally, both popnanm and popnanm2 have a license period system presumably due to licensing agreements made with the anime
  studios in order to make these games. The dongles have the date they were made and the license period baked into the dongle, with
  the license period set to 5 years each. After 5 years when the license has expired, the games disable a bunch of graphics
  (basically anything that uses the logos or characters from the featured animes) and replace them with generic graphics.
Setting the period to 00/00 instead of 05/00 is enough to turn the dongles into "forever" license dongles, so I made the patch to
  the existing dongle dumps and marked them as BAD_DUMP because they're modified data. But probably a real forever license wouldn't
  be found in the wild.
The license expired versions have significant enough differences, even if it's a worse experience, to the fully featured versions so
  I added the expired license versions as clones and the forever license version as the parents.
Lastly, all Firebeat pop'n music games have been promoted to working since they're running on par with the rest of the games in the
  driver now that the DVD images can be loaded.

11205: konami/ksys573: Fix CD region names + fix e-amusement information [987123879113]
Fixed the newly changed CD region names introduced in OG's recent DVD image commit. This covers multiple drivers.
For ksys573 specifically:
Also added some extra documentation for installation where it was non-trivial and some recent discoveries relating to rental cabinet
  types for ddr4mp/ddr4mps and dmx2/dmx2majp.
Mambo a Go Go "e-Amusement" is the rental e-Amusement and not the online service e-Amusement so I renamed it to avoid confusion, and
  also removed the NPU from its configuration because it's not used.
All of the e-Amusement CDs for GFDM actually just install the data to the NPU's HDD that should be connected to the machine. They're
  meant to be used with the main machine and not separately so I moved them into the main games as install/install2 CDs (depending
  on if the game already had an installer CD, like for the ones that had a patch CD). The envisioned usage is in the future when/if
  the NPU is working in MAME you'll switch to the e-amusement data installer CD to install the extra song data to NPU's HDD and then
  switch back to the runtime CD to run the game normally again.

11206: atari/atarigt.cpp: Added input definitions for newest version of Primal Rage [halcyon00]
This most recent romset seems like it uses a separate start button and player buttons, at least electrically.  The maps previous
  debug-only ports to p1 & p2 button4.
This change adds a new port mapping just for primrage to fix up the inputs, and renames the prior mapping to match the older roms.

11210: namco/namcos10: Add MP3 decoder support to the MEM(P3) board [987123879113]
This PR fixes the BGM in Golgo 13, BGM and voices in Nice Tsukkomi, and the BGM in Seishun-Quiz Colorful High School so those games
  have been promoted to working.
Since both Sys573 and now Namco System 10 need an MP3 decoder I moved minimp3 out to a new shared mp3_audio class styled after
  mpeg_audio (which is what I assume will contain a the layer 3 decoder in the future). Now devices don't know about minimp3 and it
  shouldn't be too difficult in the future to switch out the MP3 decoder in the future whenever layer 3 is implemented in
  mpeg_audio. This change also affects System 573 games so I also tested a few Sys573 digital games to make sure those are still
  working as well. I made a tiny modification to the minimp3 code itself to remove the exported functions but the code is otherwise
  the same as upstream.
A full datasheet for the Sanyo LC82310 isn't public so I implemented what little I could based on the little information found in
  the English and Japanese information sheets, and whatever I could figure out from usage context.
Also realized that I hadn't implemented the gun I/O correctly for Golgo 13 so I fixed that as well in this PR, which required
  implementing the AD repeat mode for the TMP95C061. While reading through the datasheet I also realized that the A/D conversion
  speed values weren't right so I changed too.

11225: Skeleton driver for 600 Cellular Activation Tester [MooglyGuy]
In addition to a simple skeleton driver that at least shows an initial readout on the LCD, this includes the following other
  changes:
- Fixed the HD6303R CPU to use an internal map derived from the M6803, and removed the now-unneeded address map entries from drivers
  using it.
- A prescale limit of 8 for systems with particularly small LCDs still produces bad-looking results, so I raised it to 20, as it
  should be relatively harmless, and any accelerated renderers will clamp to the maximum-supported texture size anyway.
- I noticed that `screen_device` was still referring to old MCFG_ macros in its logerror call to exhort devs to use raw screen
  parameters, so I replaced both with the relevant member function names.
- The Dallas DS1643 is a near-identical clone of the STMicro M48T58, so I added it to `timekpr.h/.cpp`, and noted in comments where
  certain not-yet-emulated control bits don't apply to it.

11227: video/epic12.cpp: Fix clipping of CV1K games [buffis]
Change clipping for CV1K games to draw 32 pixels surrounding the visible area.
This can be easily seen in Muchi Muchi Pork, which has a VRAM viewer in Special mode (Object Test), which will show 32 px drawn
  around the visible areas of framebuffers.
See: https://www.arcade-projects.com/threads/research-into-cv1000-blitter-performance-and-behavior.24385/#post-364121
For most gamers, this wont really matter at all... except for in Muchi Muchi Pork, where changing this actually fixes a bug for
  Rafute (yellow ship).
When Bombing with Rafute (not the other two character), the screen background will go wavy in a sine-like pattern. Currently in
  mame, the top of screen will show black pixels when this happens.
Like this: http://img.buffis.com/mmppatch/without_patch.png
With this fix for clipping, the background will instead be visible correctly.
Like this: http://img.buffis.com/mmppatch/with_patch.png
Theres still some potential for artifacts though, both at top and on right side of screen... but this happens on PCB too.
Mame with patch, top artifact: http://img.buffis.com/mmppatch/mame_top_artifacts.png
Mame with patch, right artifact: http://img.buffis.com/mmppatch/mame_top_artifacts.png

PCB right artifact: http://img.buffis.com/mmppatch/pcb_right.png
PCB footage of some bombs for reference: http://img.buffis.com/mmppatch/pcb_footage.mp4
Also renamed the "scroll registers" to have it more clear which one of these are actually used as a "scroll register" (or rather
  offset for drawing), and which one is strictly used for clipping.

Follow up to https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/11210 based on a comment from cuavas.
Tested save states in squizchs (Namco System 10) and ddrmax (Konami System 573) to make sure the known devices that use the MP3
  decoder are working now. For ddrmax I tested both in the game menus where it plays an MP3 for BGM without anything special, and
  also in-game during a song to make sure everything looked fine with the notes as they scrolled.
Also missed two save items in LC82310 so I added those in as well.

11238: ata/atapicdr, scsi/scsicd: Set CDDA image on device reset [987123879113]
This fixes the recently broken CDDA audio for CD-ROM drives. nscsi already had set_cdrom called on device_reset so no change
  required there. Tested on Konami GV, Konami Firebeat (ppp series), and Konami System 573 (early DDR games before 3rd mix).
The reason these broke is the DVD commit (https://github.com/mamedev/mame/commit/28104cdbdfc39b0ced6411381ffb074772dce345) removed
  `t10mmc::SetDevice` which was called when an image was changed and was responsible for calling `m_cdda->set_cdrom(...)`.
@galibert Please review and fix any remaining issues with CDDA before this month's release.

11244: namco/namcos10: Add partial decrypter for Point Blank 3 [Peter Wilhelmsen, Samuel Neves] [987123879113]
Redo of https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/11236 + fix a small save state-related explosion caused by the SPU if you save state in
  any PS1-based game at the wrong time (when a "valid" reverb preset isn't in the registers).
`spu_reverb_cfg` should also probably be set to null when a valid reverb preset isn't found, but that'd have noticeable changes to
  the audio for potentially all PS1 games and I don't have the energy to test that.
Edit: To give more extra info. The save state issue happens with `mrdrilr2`. Save state on the title screen or similar and load the
  save state again from command line using something like `mame mrdrilr2 -state 1`. It immediately crashes MAME due to the null
  pointer without the patch here. The reverb settings in the registers don't match any known presets so `spu_reverb_cfg` is null
  when the process function is called.

11249: BGFX and D3D9 renderer fixes for issues #11104, #11106, and #11107 [MooglyGuy]
Fix for #11107: Simply removed the erroneously copy/pasted line.
Fix for #11106: Avoiding redundant state-set calls was going awry. We now ensure that the first `set_texture` call of a scene always
  succeeds by clearing the cached texture pointer at frame start.
Fix for #11104: Calling `post_pass` and `downsample_pass` to generate bloom targets when bloom is disabled was causing issues when
  applying the post/shadowmask pass. Avoid calling them entirely if bloom is disabled, since the downsampled targets are not used
  anyway.

11250: Logging cleanup, more LOGMASKED usage, remove LOG_GENERAL redefines (#10183) [MooglyGuy]
Among tidying up logging and adjusting the formatting on LOGMASKED constants across the codebase, this change includes:
- Fixups of dead-code rot as a result of logging functions that were behind defines; this is why we don't #if-out code.
    * Added `m_video.` prefix where necessary in fmtowns_v.cpp logging.
    * Replaced now-missing SX() macro in es5510.cpp with `util::sext(value, 24)` to replace prior functionality.
- Major stylistic cleanup of mgavegas.cpp and fireball.cpp; there's no way they would have been accepted under current standards in
  their poor state:
    * Intermingling of m_ prefixed and non-m_ prefixed members.
    * Not using `output_finder`.
    * Unintelligible comments.
    * Bracing style chosen by random die-roll throughout the source files.
    * Broken space bar.
    * Seemingly random tabulation style.
    * Random ordering of driver members.
    * Using the bitwise-AND operator in an `if` statement instead of the logical-AND operator.

The ROM 1, the ram size calculation is a little off. For the base case of 256K-1.125MB, the e0/e1 memory needs to be subtracted as
  well. (Currently, a 256K apple2gsr1 has 384k).  Once you start getting into 2MB and 4MB, etc memory cards, that memory shouldn't
  be subtracted - if you install a 4MB card, you have 4megs on top of 0/1/e0/e1, for a total of 4.25MB.

-video/epic12.cpp: Fix clipping of CV1K games (#11227) [buffi]
 * Change clipping for CV1K games to draw 32 pixels surrounding the visible area.
 * This can be easily seen in Muchi Muchi Pork, which has a VRAM viewer in Special mode (Object Test), which will show 32 px drawn
    around the visible areas of framebuffers.
 * For most gamers, this wont really matter at all... except for in Muchi Muchi Pork, where changing this actually fixes a bug for
    Rafute.
 * When Bombing with Rafute, the screen background will go wavy in a sine-like pattern. Currently in mame, the top of screen will
    show black pixels when this happens.
 * With this fix for clipping, the background will instead be visible correctly.
 * Also renamed the "scroll registers" to have it more clear which one of these are actually used as a "scroll register" (or rather
    offset for drawing), and which one is strictly used for clipping.
