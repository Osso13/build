7913: zx spectrum: new slot devices, floating bus restore, big mface tidy-up [TwistedTom]
2 new slot devices: spec-mate, micro-pokeer[sic]
reinstate floating bus, slot device friendly this time
(let devices have a callback, if by the last-in-chain slot device, iorq_r hasn't returned anything, return floating bus value
  instead of just returning 0xff)
add floating bus to applicable 128k machines (not +2A,+3 they don't have it)
split up multiface devices into hardware revisions (some bios roms weren't working because h/w is different)
added correct partial decoding of ports 
fix issues with mface128, mface3 (missing logic)
add mprint missing stuff, parallel port
add mface3 pal
change default key for "magic button" (backspace is mapped for 128K machines and in natural keyboard mode)
don't clash with disk devices as it's possible to have 2 "magic button" devices chained eg. mface + beta, so use something else
  (numpad-) for disk devices
all models now work correctly with working disk interfaces: beta, opus, disciple/+d -> OK, kempston disk, +3 disk -> no write
  support
fix bug in specpls3 preventing paging lock being fully applied
move HC91+ clone into spectrum.cpp (it's a clone of 48k, not 128k)
add dual-bios cp/m roms (not working) and inf1 roms
sort out +2A,+3 bios roms:
redump english v4.0, v4.1 (the real chips are 2x 32KB not 4x 16KB)
add bios options to +2A
correct spanish v4.0 (is v4.1)
add spanish v4.0
make spanish dumps 2x 32KB not 4x 16KB to match real h/w

9137: x76f041/x76f100/zs01: Implement new operations and security features [987123879113]
All of the commits are self-contained so can be reviewed individually. There is potential to leave Sys573 in an unplayable state if
  the changes to x76f041 or zs01 are merged without the new hashes in ksys573 which is why I chose to throw this all into one PR.
x76f041 (https://datasheetspdf.com/pdf-file/292311/Xicor/X76F041/1)
- Implemented password retry counter
- Implemented new commands (password configuration, password reset, mass erase, and mass program)
- Implemented register-configured authorization checks
x76f100 (https://datasheetspdf.com/pdf-file/292328/Xicor/X76F100/1)
- Implemented password retry counter
- Implemented password configuration
zs01
- Implemented password retry counter
- Implemented new commands (password configuration, mass erase, unknown serial ID read)
- Changed data size from 4096 bytes to 112 bytes
ksys573
- Recreated all of the security flash ROMs using the System 573 master calendar device. The master calendar device is a JVS device
  that Konami created for the purpose of initializing security cassettes and RTC data.
    - z76f041: Registers were set to have a retry of 0 but also has the retry counter enabled so these would reset themselves when
  trying to do new game installations due to the way the game detects the inserted cartridge (tests game cart password and then
  tests install cart password).
    - zs01: The previous data layout wasn't a good reflection of the data (registers were treated as data so register data was
  stored halfway through the data section for example) and was too large.
    - x76f100: These were technically fine but since I was already regenerating everything else I did these too.
k573mcal
- Added the master calendar JVS device code. This could be its own PR but it was used to generate the Sys573 security cartridge data
  so I included it for reproducibility.
The following drivers are affected by these changes:
- ksys573 (x76f041, x76f100, zs01): All chips recreated.
- twinkle (x76f041): The current dumps included in MAME are proper (valid register configurations) and work as-is.
- naomi (x76f100): x76f100 format didn't change and no register data to worry about so the existing ROMs should work as-is.

According to contents of operator's manual (https://archive.org/details/arcademanual_RockNRage), some DIP switch settings need to be
  corrected and added.

9201: Remove http related header pollution [mmicko]
make emu.h.gch file 20MB smaller and prevent full recompile on asio and http file handling changes

9202: New software list for the Tandy/Memorex VIS [rzero9]
This adds a new software list for the Tandy/Memorex VIS with 70 entries, which should be almost the entire library of the system. I
  have tested them but not too extensively, so I may have missed some bugs.
To allow the discs to auto-mount from the command line, this also adds a set_interface line to the Mitsumi ISA CD adapter used by
  the VIS.

9215: bus/a2bus: Added Apple II 3.5" Disk Controller Card [ksherlock]
Apple II 3.5" Disk Controller Card.
n.b. - mame's 65c02 implementation has incorrect false reads when crossing page boundaries.  This needs to be fixed for the  uc code
  to work correctly.
The firmware modifies the apple iigs rombank statereg bit to check if it's a IIgs or a IIe.
Writing to an 1.44MB MFM disk image frequently errors out due to transition too wide errors. 

9216: inufuku.cpp: Add notes for undumped game [cam900]

9217: bus/nes: Updated all Konami VRC boards. [0kmg]
- Added missing WRAM enable bit (VRC4/6/7).
- Simplified handling of pins that connect to variable address lines (VRC2/4/6/7). VRC7's pin 19 now is configured dynamically like
  the others.
- For each VRC chip, masked bank numbers to reflect actual ROM size supported by pinout.
- Removed unreachable logging statements, other assorted cleanups and simplifications.

9218: spectrum: move gfx to screen_device [holub]
POC for modernization of screen_device usage.
This implementation is done on self-contained Pentagon driver with intention to be moved to parent spectrum.
Improvements:
* gfx rendered directly on screen_device without intermediate bitmaps (m_border_bitmap, m_screen_bitmap)
* INT raised on beginning of vblank instead of manually adjusted position
* position of the gfx can be moved to arbitrary position (see: PENTAGON_SCREEN), not customly hardcoded at (0,0). That respects
  vblank/hblank positions "before" real screen, not wrongly "after" previously.

9220: playch10.cpp: Correct NT mirroring for various games (MT 02646). [0kmg]

9228: misc (mostly negative status) changes [DavidHaywood]
cave.cpp : use u58 from parent set for 'donpachikr' - fixes corrupt graphics in ending
kyugo.cpp : mark PROMs in 99lstwarb as bad, there's no way these PROMs can give the correct colours for the unique 1st stage in this
  set.
tsamurai.cpp : mark nunchaku PROMs as bad, there's no way these PROMs can give the colours seen in reference videos, if these *were*
  on the PCB it must have been a bootleg conversion
megaplay.cpp: : demote mp_bio to NOT WORKING, it frequently locks up on continue, usually the 2nd or so continue on the 2nd stage,
  likely another manifestation of the mp_shnb3 timing comms issue.

9229: cave.cpp: Add notes for version/date string in ROM, Fix version/date format string in metadata matches to in-game display
  [cam900]
"International" sets are means non-regional specific ("World") release, like other driver game/machines; except hotdogst (Ace
  international - Distributor)

9230: HP9825: added printer output on a screen and cassette status [fulivi]

9290: ctk551: correct release year, add mask ROM label [devinacker]
Changed the year to 2000 based on the product page on CasioPart (which seems to have only gone online sometime within the last few
  months). The original 1999 date was taken from the (nearly identical) CTK-541 service manual.

9291: swim1/swim2 - initialize m_floppy and m_timer [ksherlock]
I encountered some odd crashes testing the a2superdrive slot options (eg, `mame apple2ee -sl7 superdrive -sl7:superdrive:fdc:0 35sd`
  ). Poking further, swim1 had an invalid `m_floppy` since it is never initialized.  swim2 would also have the same issue.  There's
  also a timer in swim1 that isn't initialized.

9292: nes, playch10.cpp, vsnes.cpp: Made zapper sensor fuzzier. [0kmg]

I have been working on the AT&T UNIX PC driver (68010) and ran into an issue with page fault handling. I tracked this back to the
  RTE instruction for 68010 wherein the SP can potentially be changed mid-unwind of the bus error exception stack frame (format =
  8), when transitioning from supervisor mode back to user mode (A7 being set to USP).
I also added 68010 format 8 stack frame setup in the bus error handling code.  This code is presently inaccessible to 68010, due to
  the `pmmu_enabled` conditional. But that is a separate topic being discussed in issue #9170

9294: Address some Lua scripting pitfalls [cuavas]
This addresses several pitfalls in the Lua scripting interface:
* Addressed pure virtual function call crash on end of emulation session if you haven’t explicitly removed all address space taps.
* Addressed memory corruption on end of emulation session if you haven’t explicitly removed all address space change notifiers.
* Symbol tables won’t be garbage-collected out from under you while you have parsed expressions or other symbol tables that depend
  on them.
* Removed the copy constructor for parsed expressions as the underlying C++ copy constructor appears to be broken.
* Fixed breakpoint/watchpoint objects being inappropriately copied into the tables returned by `bplist()` and `wplist()`, which
  allows the `enabled` property to be modifiable for breakpoint and watchpoint objects in Lua.
* Fixed some errors in the Lua API reference documentation.
Drivers and devices that use taps have been updated for the API changes.  Also fixed drivers and devices causing a new memory
  pass-through handler to be allocated on each soft reset, and fixed multiple instances of taps being installed in the event the
  machine is reset before the tap is removed.
Also adds classes for managing broadcast subscriptions, and adapts address spaces to use this for change notifications.  They’re
  currently built to minimise dynamic allocations, avoid the need for any virtual member functions, and keep the subscription
  objects light-weight.  If the trade-offs are deemed inappropriate, the implementation can be changed without breaking source
  compatibility.

 * 68010: create 1000 format stack frame on bus error

-Addressed some Lua scripting pitfalls. (#9294) [Vas Crabb]
 * Addressed pure virtual function call crash on end of emulation session if you haven't explicitly removed all address space taps,
    memory corruption on end of emulation session if you haven't explicitly removed all address space change notifiers, and symbol
    being garbage-collected out from under you while you have parsed expressions or other symbol tables that depend on them.
 * Removed the copy constructor for parsed expressions as the underlying C++ copy constructor appears to be broken, and simplified
    symbol table constructors.  Also made symbol table add methods return the new entry to avoid the need for an extra lookup.
 * Fixed breakpoint/watchpoint objects being inappropriately copied into the tables returned by bplist() and wplist(), allowing the
    enabled property to be modifiable for breakpoint and watchpoint objects in Lua.
 * Fixed drivers and devices causing a new memory pass-through handler to be allocated on each soft reset, and fixed multiple
    instances of taps being installed in the event the machine is reset before the tap is removed.
 * Added classes for managing broadcast subscriptions, and adapted address spaces to use this for change notifications.
