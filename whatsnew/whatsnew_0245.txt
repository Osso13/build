Also identified 'prospdp' as another set of 'Diana Bifuca'

9635: Initial work towards a sis630 based chipset driver [angelosa]
* Add more or less complete implementations of sis630_host, sis950_lpc, sis630_gui, sis5513_ide, sis7001_usb, sis7018_audio,
  sis900_eth devices;
* Removed gamecstl.cpp in favour to the new sis630.cpp driver;
* i386.cpp: enable CMOV feature for Pentium III and 4;
* i386.cpp: add PSN stub feature for Pentium III;

9664: gts3a.cpp: Dumped and added a new 'Wipeout' set [clawgrip]
Dumped and added a new 'Wipeout' set. 
Also:
* Made the newest revisions to be the parents sets (some games on this driver had the newest, but others the oldest) and reorder de
  ROM loads accordingly (newer to older).
* Reformatted single line comments.
* Renamed some sets to follow the driver name scheme and to avoid confusion with other games on different drivers.

Wipeout (rev.2, alt) [Victor Fernandez (City Game)]

9672: add notes: SD2000 and SU2000 hardware, list of games [simzy39]
(this is just info for when someone does start a driver)
-First attempt at listing that there are SU2000 (Stand Up) and SD2000 (Sit Down) models
-Attempt at listing the 2000 platform's software (same base hardware, so each system theoretically runs the same software)
-Added a link to SU2000 Technical Manual
-Listed the main base hardware (shared by SD2000 and SU2000)

9713: ibm5150.xml: Mark some cracked images [Allofich]
The Wizardry IV, Wizardry V and non-alternate Summer Games II entries in this list are for cracked images but not marked as so.
Wizardry IV
!20220507-165912-755755
Wizardry V
!20220507-170212-881881
Summer Games II
!20220507-153006-489489
I followed the convention used for other cracked games in this file, as in
`<info name="cracked" value="demonlord" />`
although I feel "Cracked by" would look better than "cracked" in the MAME UI, and I think "Demonlord" (capitalized) would be
  correct.
Also Summer Games II has an alternate entry, and that one is not clearly cracked (it does not advertise itself as so, at least), so
  it seems like it should perhaps be the parent, not the cracked one.

9761: saturn.xml: Metadata cleaning [ArcadeShadow]
Renaming Prototype, Alt, Rev, Demo words to lowercase

9762: Z180 ASCI [mmicko]
This is rework of Z180 ASCI implementation, done according to comments from https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/9644 
@cuavas and @ajrhacker  Would appreciate review and suggestions on z180 asci channel encapsulation in z180 implementation.
ASCI itself is still implemented using device_buffered_serial_interface that I plan to replace, but that should not affect interface
  side from drivers and z180 cpu core, so please concentrate on parts other then z180asci.*,  but of course it would be good to get
  feedback if something in ASCI should be taken care as well.

9778: K054539: Fix DPCM table and add cubic interpolation. [SaxxonPike]
DPCM fix: Previously, the DPCM table in K054539 used squares (1,4,9,16,etc). The new table uses powers of two (1,2,4,8,etc). This
  fixes DC offsets for 4-bit sample playback.
Sample interpolation: the K054539 internally uses a form of sample interpolation to soften aliasing for low bitrate samples. A
  variety of resampling methods have been tested and the closest one we could find was cubic.
Testing was done with Beatmania, Pop'n Music, Lethal Enforcers and Xexex.

9788: Removed device_timer, device_timer_id, et al in favor of direct callback members. [MooglyGuy]
Primarily, this removes `device_t::device_timer`, `device_t::timer_set`, `device_t::synchronize`, `device_t::timer_expired`, and
  `device_timer_id`. Use of `device_timer` often resulted in unnecessary trampolining in addition to switch/case overhead on a
  driver/device level, and additional logic to manage delegated vs. ID-based timers on a core level. In the worst cases, devices
  were performing a switch/case with only one valid case.
`device_scheduler::timer_set` is marked deprecated as the only existing direct use is via the Lua engine, with the remaining uses
  occurring via `device_scheduler::synchronize`, which will be removed later in favor of explicitly allocated `emu_timer` instances.
As a middle ground between the extremely short `timer_alloc()` and the extremely long
  `machine().scheduler().timer_alloc(timer_expired_delegate(FUNC(widget_device::contoso_tick), this))`, a helper function in
  `device_t` has been added which can be invoked with the following syntax:
`timer_alloc(FUNC(widget_device::contoso_tick), this)`

9797: clcd.cpp: Use 1 MHz for system clock. [mnaberez]
Use 1 MHz for the system clock of the Commodore LCD based on hardware and firmware evidence from Bil Herd's prototype.  The emulator
  uses the ROM code dumped from this same prototype.
### Hardware
A photo of Bil Herd's prototype shows a 4.0 MHz crystal above the G65SC102.  It is likely that the crystal is connected to pins 35
  (XTLI) and 37 (XTLO).  The GTE 65SC102 datasheet says, "the 65SC10X Series is supplied with an internal clock generator operating
  at four times the Φ2 frequency."  The Rockwell R65C102 datasheet agrees, saying, "The R65C102 internal clocks may be generated by
  a TTL level single phase input, an RC time base input, (÷ 4) using the XTLO and XTLI input pins.  See Figure 7 for an example of a
  crystal time base circuit."  Figure 7 reiterates, "R65C102 crystal frequency is divided by 4, i.e. Φ2 (OUT) = F/4."
### Firmware
The following code snippets are disassemblies of the KERNAL ROM.
VIA1 Timer 1 is configured here:
```text
877E                    ;TOD clock code in IRQ handler expects to be called at 60 Hz.
877E                    ;60 Hz has a period of 16666 microseconds.
877E                    ;Timer 1 fires every 16666 microseconds by counting Phi2.
877E                    ;Phi2 must be 1 MHz, since 1 MHz has a period of 1 microsecond.
877E  A9 1A             lda     #<16666

8785  8D 05 F8          sta     VIA1_T1CH
```
IRQ handler that runs when Timer 1 elapses:
```text
FA3C  2C 0D F8  LFA3C:  bit     VIA1_IFR
FA3F  10 02             bpl     LFA43               ;Branch if IRQ was not caused by VIA1
FA41  70 01             bvs     LFA44_VIA1_T1_IRQ   ;Branch if VIA1 Timer 1 caused the interrupt
FA43  60        LFA43:  rts

The handler calls this routine to update the TOD clock, which expects to be called at 60 Hz:

This adds the default MFM floppy formats to the HP 9122c floppy drive. It allows the HP 9000/3xx machines to actually use the floppy
  images in the software list, which were failing to load before (loudly or silently, depending on the method used to load them).
HP BASIC and HP Pascal are now bootable from floppy, for example, though HP-UX 5.1 still doesn't work (for unrelated reasons,
  probably).

This a continuation of where I left off in #9184 due to my repo being funky earlier causing a refork.
So yes I’ve seen some videos where the Korean sets used the Japanese Keisatsukan title text in them even though they have Korean and
  some English for the how to’s and ranks, etc, etc.

9819: marblmd2.cpp: Added Marble Madness II driver [DavidHaywood]
new WORKING machines

Marble Madness II (prototype) [anonymous]

9826: volfied.cpp: Changed joysticks from 8-way to 4-way [johansmolinski]
Referring to issue #9824
This game should be configured to be used with a 4-way controller, as playing with an 8-way joystick is very hard. This is supported
  in the manual: "The control of this game uses one 4-way lever and one button".
https://www.arcade-museum.com/manuals-videogames/V/Volfied.pdf

9827: marblmd2.cpp - removed /2 on clock, now runs 68k at 14Mhz like Batman + hook up EEPROM [DavidHaywood]
- remove divider on 68000 so that clock matches Batman
- hook up EEPROM

9828: Add support for Space Duel’s cocktail mode. [ieure]
This change introduces a cabinet type setting which allows Space Duel to be placed into cocktail mode.  When run in a cocktail
  cabinet, the game:
 - Strobes the invert x & invert y outputs to rotate the video 180 degrees.  This is necessary because the monitor in the SD
  cocktail is mounted upside-down relative to the upright.
 - Draws the player 2 score in an orientation where they can be read by the second player, who stands on the opposite side of the
  cabinet as player one.
In addition to the driver support, I had to implement video flipping in avg_device, as it didn’t support it.

9830: jpmsru: Sort out remaining games, add new ones [SomeRandomGuyIdk]
- Support for remaining games from the previous SRU skeleton driver
- New games & clones
- Some cleanups (per-game mconfigs replaced with a macro, is that OK?)

9833: Add Link - The Faces of Evil (USA) to CD-i softlist [ajshell1]
TOSEC doesn't have the USA version of  Link - The Faces of Evil, so I thought I'd use the Redump version.
Feel free to let me know if any changes are necessary.

9834: netlist: palloc now uses c++17 alignment aware operator new. [couriersud]
- Added more documentation to palloc.h
- Made the use of allocation arenas more transparent throughout code
- palloc now uses c++17 alignment aware operator new.
  This required further changes to the arena_deleter object to
  track alignment and size of allocated objects to avoid the use
  of aligment and size of base classes in case a unique_ptr was down
  casted to a unique_ptr of the base class.

9837: [spectrum_cass.xml] Added missing MicroHobby tapes [ICEknigh7]

9841: netlist: static solver work and improve code readability [couriersud]
- add support for individual static solver files.
  The static_solvers.cpp file has been grown big now. This commit adds
  support to nltool to generate a file which includes individual files.
  This has the advantage that the files can be better compared to
  previous versions.
  This will be enabled in a separate commit for better traceability.
  The static solvers in the generated files are now sorted to improve
  readability and understanding.
  In addition man pages for nltool and nlwav have been added.
- extended typed_version to have patchlevel as well.
- More compilation of ppmf.h with nvcc
- create_devinc.py: add protection header to the generated file
- makefile: recreate generated files when python code has changed
- reduce nld_base.h usage in the core
- move extern template class definitions where they belong
- Generally improved code readability
  Fixed a lot of issues cspell reported

9842: rbowlorama.cpp: Add info about I/O board [Museo del Recreativo] [clawgrip]

9843: clcd.cpp: Added IEC bus connections. [mnaberez]
Add IEC bus connections to the Commodore LCD based on firmware evidence from Bil Herd's LCD prototype and the schematics released by
  Bil.
I disassembled the IEC code in the KERNAL ROM to find the connections.  With these additions and the clock fix, IEC almost works but
  most of the time it locks up.  Since we don't know if the IEC support in the LCD prototype ever actually worked, the problem could
  be the KERNAL or an emulation bug.
Out of dozens of attempts, I got a disk directory from `c1541` twice.  Since it got that far, I think the signals are hooked up
  correctly.  I asked Curt about it and he thought so too.  I hadn't committed the patch because I wanted to look into it more, but
  then Bil released the schematics.  They confirm the connections.  Since that is the case, and the emulator still works as it did
  before this change, I don't see any harm in committing this.
### Disassembly
The IEC routines are extremely similar to those in the C64 (see below).  The pin assignments are the same but the two input lines
  are inverted.

</details>
The IEC signals are connected to VIA1 ($F800):
| Pin | IEC Signal | Polarity | Source |
|-----|-----|----------|--------|
|VIA1 PB7 |DAT_IN  |inverted from C64   |DEBPIA $BE3E |
|VIA1 PB6 |CLK_IN  |inverted from C64   |DEBPIA $BE3E |
|VIA1 PB5 |DAT_OUT |same as C64 |DATAHI $BE2C, DATALO $BE35 |
|VIA1 PB4 |CLK_OUT |same as C64 |CLKHI $BE1A, CLKLO $BE23 |
|VIA1 PB3 |ATN_OUT |same as C64 |SCATN $BD4C, LIST5 $BCB8 |
VIA1 Timer 2 is used in one-shot mode for IEC bus timing.  It is not used for interrupts but is polled by the IEC bus routines
  (ISRCLK at $BD11, ISR04 at $BD2C, EOIACP at $BDB3, and ACP00 at $BDBB).
### Testing
Run `mame clcd` with no drive options and the emulator will work as before.  The device tree will show the IEC bus but no attached
  drive, since the LCD is a laptop that wouldn't normally have an external drive attached.
Run it again with `-iec8 c1541`.  In the debugger, switch to `c1541`'s CPU and `bpset ea2d`.  In the drive ROM, $EA2D is the end of
  ACPTR, the routine that receives a byte from IEC.  When sitting at the LCD's power-on menu, the breakpoint will soon be hit and
  the accumulator will contain $5F.  This shows that the 1541 successfully received the UNLISTEN ($5F) command on IEC.  The menu
  sends UNLISTEN periodically due to a bug in the LCD KERNAL's CLRCHN routine described below.
<details>
  <summary>CLRCHN Bug (click to expand)</summary>
  ```text
  BAD7  ;XXX This is a bug.  This routine assumes that any device > 3 is an
  BAD7  ;IEC device that needs to be UNTLKed or UNLSNed.  That was true on other
  BAD7  ;machines but the LCD has two new devices, the Centronics port ($1E / 30)
  BAD7  ;and the RTC ($1F / 31), that are not IEC.  When one of these devices is
  BAD7  ;open, this routine will needlessly send UNLSN or UNTLK to IEC.  This can
  BAD7  ;be seen at the power-on menu.  The menu continuously polls the RTC via
  BAD7  ;CHRIN and calls CLALL after each poll, which comes here (CLRCHN), and an
  BAD7  ;unnecessary UNTLK is sent.  To fix this, ignore devices $1E and $1F here.
  BAD7  CLRCHN: ldx     #3        ;Device 3 (Screen)
  BAD9
  BAD9          cpx     DFLTO     ;Compare 3 to default output channel
  BADC          bcs     LBAE1     ;Branch if DFLTO <= 3 (not IEC)
  BADE          jsr     UNLSN     ;Device is IEC so UNLSN

  BAE1  LBAE1:  cpx     DFLTN     ;Compare 3 to default input channel
  BAE4          bcs     LBAE9     ;Branch if DFLTN <= 3 (not IEC)
  BAE6          jsr     UNTLK     ;Device is IEC so UNTLK

  BAE9  LBAE9:  stx     DFLTO     ;Default output device = 3 (Screen)
  BAEC          stz     DFLTN     ;Default output device = 0 (Keyboard)
  BAEF          rts
  ```
</details>
If the LCD menu does not come up, delete the `nvram`.  That issue is not related to this change.
### Screenshot
I took the attached screenshot after one of the times I saw it work.  However, most of the time, it locks up.

9884: 8080bw.cpp, mw8080bw.cpp: Some cleanup/untangling [cuavas]
Updated Space Invaders C.V. and Space Invaders Part II input definitions based on schematics and manuals.  There's a legacy port
  definition for games that previously included the `sicv` ports to hopefully reduces the amount of breakage this can cause.
Got Space Invaders specific stuff out of the Midway 8080 B/W base class. I/O ports are still optional because some games don't use
  the indirect setup for reading player inputs on different cabinet types.
Got some of the game-specific stuff out of the `_8080bw_state` class. It's still a bit of a mess because sound hardware is
  implemented in the driver classes so some games pull in a more derived class than they really should just for sound handlers.
Got rid of the duplicate joystick inputs in `rollingc`.

9901: ksys573: Use dsem2 BIOS like real hardware for mamboagg [987123879113]
https://callusnext.com/archives/605
`mamboagg` uses the 700B01 BIOS (known as "dsem2" in MAME) on real hardware. The CRC mentioned, `6CF852AF`, also matches the `dsem2`
  BIOS currently in MAME. The change has no noticeable differences in gameplay.

9910: dp83932c.cpp: Support BE mode and transmission packet appending [briceonk]
This PR has two additions to the SONIC driver:
1. Add support for big endian bus accesses by adjusting the width of the bus access appropriately (In 32-bit mode, descriptors and
  the RBA must all be aligned to longword boundaries, even when the values are only 16 bit, thus the previous method had issues on
  BE buses. See pages 7 and 15 in the datasheet)
2. Stop driver from starting a second transaction task if one is already in progress. The datasheet recommends that software which
  wants to append packets during a transmission send another transmission command to avoid a race condition, and it should do
  nothing if this command is received while the transfer is still ongoing. NEWS-OS 4.2.1aRD is an example of software that does
  this. It would hang on boot without this change because the SONIC would start doing weird things when the second transmit command
  came in.

9915: ui, docs: Added menus to fill a couple of gaps, improved consistency [cuavas]
Added menus for controlling toggle inputs, and showing recognised input devices and control state.  This plugs a couple of usability
  holes.  Toggle inputs like locking caps lock keys can be rather annoying to deal with when testing if you can’t check their state,
  and writing a layout just to see them is a lot of effort.  You can now see whether MAME recognises your input devices from within
  the UI (no need to use `-verbose`), and also see what controls MAME believes each device has, and whether they respond as
  expected.  This should help users diagnose issues, and it should make support easier when you can tell users how to find the info
  in MAME’s UI.
Moved input menu options off main menu to a submenu, as there are a lot of them now (you can end up with five of them in extreme
  cases).
Changed the default names for buttons and hat switches/D-pads to use 1-based numbering.  DirectInput still returns 0-based button
  numbers for some devices but I think that comes from the drivers themselves.
Moved menu heading drawing into base class, added headings to more menus, and made headings more consistent with the menu items used
  to reach them.  Also made it possible for the “selector” menu to have a meaningful heading rather than always saying “Selection
  List” (and fixed a bug that could cause it to not respond to keys/buttons).
Started adding documentation for menus, to hopefully help people find menus they remember seeing but can't recall how to access.
  This will be expanded when I have time.
Improved consistency in terminology:
* Completely removed the confusing “ROM set”/“romset” from the English UI – people use it to mean at least three different things.
* Standardised on using “system” to refer to complete, runnable systems.  “Machine” is used to refer to devices in some place (e.g.
  the `-listxml` output), and in most cases the UI uses “driver” to refer to a source file where systems/devices are defined.
* Prefer “Settings” over “Configuration” in a number of places, especially the menus used for adjusting settings that are saved in
  INI files.  “Configuration” could be construed as specifically referring to CFG files.  Also, references to “machine
  configuration” in those menus could be confused with the options available on the “Machine Configuration” menu.
* Controls on host input devices (e.g. keys, buttons and joystick axes) are referred to as “controls”.
* Emulated inputs are referred to as “inputs”.
* Menus for assigning controls to inputs are now called “Input Assignments” menus.  Simply calling them “Input” menus was not
  specific enough, considering there are several other menus affecting inputs.
* The former “Analog Controls” menu is now “Analog Input Adjustments”, to better reflect what it does.  (It works with emulated
  inputs rather than host controls, and it’s for adjustments only, as assignment for analog inputs is on the same menus as digital
  inputs.)
* Combinations of controls that can be assigned to emulated inputs, UI functions, plugin actions, etc. are now referred to as
  “combinations” rather than “sequences”.  Calling them “sequences” was always leaking an implementation detail – from the user’s
  point of view, the program responds to a combination of controls (controls activated simultaneously), not a sequence (controls
  activated one after another).
Also, a bunch of minor fixes and improvements, including:
* Added message context to the localisable messages for a few menus to make translators’ lives a bit easier.  I’ve only really made
  a small start on this – there’s far more to do.
* emu/rendfont.cpp: Made `render_font::string_width` behave better when encountering invalid UTF-8.
* ui/viewgfx.cpp: Fixed drawing titles when characters outside 7-bit ASCII are present, and improved localisation support.
* ui/miscmenu.cpp: Improved wording on the crosshair options menu.
* ui: Changed the gutter width for menus to exactly half the line height.
* Fixed building the DirectSound module on Windows with the SDL OSD – the Windows headers need to be included in a particular order.
* Removed the local copy of the XAudio2 header from the source as MinGW includes it now.
* Fixed various issues in the documentation, including an error in the description of `memory_bank::set_base`.
* Filled in a few message translations in Japanese and Serbian.
* Bumped the documentation version to 0.245 as it now documents features that are not in 0.244 as released.
I’ve patched up some existing message translations for changes in terminology, but I may have made some mistakes in the process.  If
  you’re running MAME localised, keep an eye out for errors.

9918: sound.cpp: Fix missed samples due to state save (#9917) [couriersud]
The PR address #9917. A save state may occur between time slices.
Sound devices through sound.cpp are updated during a timer call every
20ms. When the state is saved, these devices are not updated to the
current machine time. Consequently after a state load the devices
have a "time lag" since in postload buffer end time is forced to
machine time.
This change will save the last buffer end time so that all outstanding
samples are processed.
This is a core change. I tested it on some drivers. This needs a very
thorough review and I post the PR primarily to document a possible
solution.

9919: jpmsru.cpp: Added new sets, fixed audio [SomeRandomGuyIdk]
- Added 3 new sets

9920: y2.cpp: higurashi small title consistency. [mikehyrus]

9921: punchout.cpp: Correctly labeled service button and coin 2 inputs. [0kmg]

9923: r4000.cpp: Partially implement secondary cache tag manipulation [briceonk]
Partially implements the secondary cache piece of the CACHE instruction. Only tag manipulation is supported (so this is just a
  half-step towards a full secondary cache subsystem for this driver), but the benefit is that software that uses the tag to
  determine how much secondary cache is present will be able to do so (even though the driver will still treat every memory access
  as a secondary cache hit).
This is useful for emulating devices like the Sony NWS-5000X. The NEWS-OS 4.2.1aRD kernel (which only supports the NWS-5000 series
  and thus doesn't have to deal with computers that don't have a secondary cache) uses the scache size early in kernel
  initialization (seems to use it when figuring out the VM page size or something like that). So, this partial implementation is
  enough to satisfy it since it can now correctly enumerate the secondary cache size.
@pmackinlay (or anyone else who uses this driver), if this conflicts with what you had in mind for this driver re: cache
  implementation, let me know. I can refactor or change this however you'd like :)

9943: Added implementation for thunderl protection [sergiopolog]
Added implementation of Thunder & Lightning (thunderl) protection. This could be useful in case other sets of the game shows up and
  uses the protection with other values than the current one hardcoded in the driver.
The protection is implemented using a registered PALCE16V8H labeled TL-9:
https://i.imgur.com/VqqnQOs.jpg
Main CPU performs several writtings to the address space mapped to the PAL to save a value into registers.
Eventually, CPU reads back that value and performs some checkings. If the value is not the proper one, a soft reset is done.
Address during writting operation is mapped in the following way:
   A2  -> I2
   A3  -> I3
   A6  -> I4
   A8  -> I5
   A11 -> I6
   A13 -> I7
   A15 -> I8
   A16 -> I9
Data sent by the CPU during these writting operations is not used to calculate the protection register value, only some address
  lines are used to compute the value, as shown above.
Every write operation done to the PAL discards the previous stored value in the registers and stores a new computed value, following
  the logic equations programmed in the PAL.
   (I1 = CLK : pulses when accessing to writting handler and acts as clock for internal latches in PAL)
   (I11 = /OE : asserted when accessing to reading handler. Sub-address used for reading here is no used to compute the result
  value)
Also, added the dump for the actual PAL recreated by the above analysis, and the address range for the protection writting handler
  is updated. It goes up to CPU A16 address line : 0x400000, 0x41ffff (even if never used in the current game code)

9947: netlist: fix bug, prepare for future changes and improve readability [couriersud]
- fix a bug where a net processing error may trigger a nullptr access
- applied some clang-tidy recommendations
- add no_return to plib::terminate
- properly encapsulate dynamic_cast usage
- more review of noexcept
- added a clang-format file. Over time, all source files will be
  processed with clang-format
- Used clang-format on a number of files
- Rewrote 74174
- all device constructors now use a struct to pass data on
  to base classes. Neither netlist state nor the name are intended
  to be used in a constructor. After the base class was
  constructed, they can be accessed by state() and name().
- The device construction macros can now be removed. Changes to
  the core will not need to be reflected in constructors.
- Change truth table macros so that going forward NETLIST_END and
  TRUTH_TABLE_END can be replaced by a closing curly brace. netlists can
  than use curly braces enclosed blocks.

At times std::vector<menu_item> m_items found in src/frontend/mame/ui/menu.h is empty, even after displaying a full list, triggering
  this assertion:
/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/11.3.0/include/g++-v11/bits/stl_vector.h:1045: std::vector<_Tp, _Alloc>::reference std::vector<_Tp,

9981: Considerable DSP56156 + plygonet.cpp fixes [MooglyGuy]

  that's not happening today.

9982: mpu4bwb.cpp - set identification / defaults for booting [DavidHaywood]
this identifies the settings various sets in mpu4bwb.cpp expect, and configures them better by default.

-Add support for Space Duel’s cocktail mode. (#9828) [Ian Eure]
 * Add support for Space Duel’s cocktail mode.
   - This change introduces a cabinet type setting which allows Space Duel to be placed into cocktail mode.  When run in a cocktail
      cabinet, the game:
     * Strobes the invert x & invert y outputs to rotate the video 180 degrees.  This is necessary because the monitor in the SD
        cocktail is mounted upside-down relative to the upright.
     * Draws the player 2 score in an orientation where they can be read by the second player, who stands on the opposite side of
        the cabinet as player one.
   - In addition to the driver support, I had to implement video flipping in avg_device, as it didn’t support it.

New working clones
------------------
Cookie & Bibi 2 (English / Korean) [f205v]

-gokidetor.cpp: Rename Gokidetor to La Cucaracha (#9883) [eientei95]

-revert: mephisto_mm2: swap oldest 2 sets [hap]

-machine/dmv_keyb.cpp: Corrected typo in DIP swithc label. (#9887) [rfka01]

-Removed device_timer, device_timer_id, et al in favor of direct callback members. (#9788) [MooglyGuy]
 * Primarily, this removes device_t::device_timer, device_t::timer_set, device_t::synchronize, device_t::timer_expired, and
    device_timer_id. Use of device_timer often resulted in unnecessary trampolining in addition to switch/case overhead on a
    driver/device level, and additional logic to manage delegated vs. ID-based timers on a core level.  In the worst cases, devices
    were performing a switch/case with only one valid case.
 * device_scheduler::timer_set is marked deprecated as the only remaining direct uses are via the Lua engine and a few drivers that
    need refactoring anyway.  The remaining uses occur via device_scheduler::synchronize.
 * As a middle ground between the extremely short timer_alloc() and the extremely long
    machine().scheduler().timer_alloc(timer_expired_delegate(FUNC(widget_device::contoso_tick), this)), a helper function in
    device_t has been added which can be invoked with the following syntax: timer_alloc(FUNC(widget_device::contoso_tick), this)

 * Got Space Invaders specific stuff out of the Midway 8080 B/W base class.
 * Got some of the game-specific stuff out of the _8080bw_state class. It's still a bit of a mess because sound hardware is
    implemented in the driver classes so some games pull in a more derived class than they really should just for sound handlers.

    version as a proxy for standard library version is bad, but it's the path of least resistance for now).

-netlist/plib: Fix compile with Apple clang. [Vas Crabb]

-mess.lua: place hh_ collection drivers and their subclasses together [hap]

-ui, docs: Added menus to fill a couple of gaps, improved consistency. (#9915) [Vas Crabb]
 * Added menus for controlling toggle inputs, and showing recognised input devices and control state.  Moved input menu options off
    main menu to a submenu, as there are a lot of them now.
 * Moved menu heading drawing into base class, added headings to more menus, and made headings more consistent with the menu items
    used to reach them.  Also made terminology more consistent.
 * Changed the default names for buttons and hat switches/D-pads to use 1-based numbering.  DirectInput still returns 0-based button
    numbers for some devices.
 * Removed local copy of MinGW xaudio2.h as it’s now included in the MSYS2 package.  Also fixed building the DirectSound sound
    output module with the SDL OSD on Windows - the Windows headers are sensitive to include order.
 * Started adding documentation for menus, to hopefully help people find menus they remember seeing but can't recall how to access.
 * For translators, this makes terminology more consistent.  In particular:
   - "Settings" is preferred over "configuration" in a number of places, as the latter can be construed as referring specifically to
      settings stored in .cfg files in the cfg_directory folder.  Also, references to saving machine configuration could be
      interpreted as relating to the settings on the "Machine Configuration" menu.
   - The controls on host input devices (e.g. keys, buttons, joystick axes) are referred to as "controls", while emulated inputs are
      referred to as "inputs".
   - The menus for assigning host controls to emulated inputs are called "input assignments" menus to distinguish them from other
      input settings menus.
   - Combinations of controls that can be assigned to emulated inputs are referred to as "combinations" rather than "sequences".
   - The potentially confusing term "ROM set" has been removed altogether. Use "short name" to refer to a device or system's
      identifier.
   - "System" is used in almost places to refer to a complete, runnable system rather than "Machine".
   - "Driver" is now only used to refer to source files where systems or devices are defined - it is no longer used to refer to
      individual systems.
   - A few more menus have message context for the messages.  This makes it a bit easier to guess where the messages are used.  It
      also means you can use different translations in different places if necessary (e.g. if the same English text should be
      translated differently as an item in one menu and as a heading in another).

-Changed the constructor of fs::dir_entry to take 'std::string &&name' instead of 'const std::string &name' (#9913) [npwoods]

--------------------------
Super Poker (V100xD03) / Formosa [Luca Elia, ANY]

-machine/dp83932c.cpp: Support BE mode and transmission packet appending (#9910) [Brice Onken]
 * Added support for big endian bus accesses by adjusting the width of the bus access appropriately.  (In 32-bit mode, descriptors
    and the RBA must all be aligned to 32-bit boundaries, even when the values are only 16 bit, thus the previous method had issues
    on BE buses.  See pages 7 and 15 in the datasheet.)
 * Stop device from starting a second transaction task if one is already in progress.  The datasheet recommends that software which
    wants to append packets during a transmission send another transmission command to avoid a race condition, and it should do
    nothing if this command is received while the transfer is still ongoing.  NEWS-OS 4.2.1aRD is an example of software that does
    this.  It would hang on boot without this change because the SONIC would start doing weird things when the second transmit
    command came in.

-sound.cpp: Fix missed samples due to state save (#9917) (#9918) [couriersud]
 * sound.cpp: Fix missed samples due to state save (#9917)
   - The PR address #9917. A save state may occur between time slices. Sound devices through sound.cpp are updated during a timer
      call every 20ms. When the state is saved, these devices are not updated to the current machine time. Consequently after a
      state load the devices have have a "time lag" since in postload buffer end time is forced to machine time. This change will
      save the last buffer end time so that all outstanding samples are processed.
   - This is a core change. I tested it on some drivers. This needs a very thorough review and I post the PR primarily to document a
      possible solution.
 * sound.cpp: use "stream.sound_stream" as module name for save_item
 * sound.cpp: use presave handler to store end_time()

-netlist: fix bug, prepare for future changes and improve readability (#9947) [couriersud]
 * netlist: fix bug, prepare for future changes and improve readability
   - fix a bug where a net processing error may trigger a nullptr access
   - applied some clang-tidy recommendations
   - add no_return to plib::terminate
   - properly encapsulate dynamic_cast usage
   - more review of noexcept
   - added a clang-format file. Over time, all source files will be processed with clang-format
   - Used clang format on a number of files
   - Rewrote 74174
   - all device constructors now use a struct to pass data on to base classes. Neither netlist state nor the name are intended to be
      used in a constructor. After the base class was constructed, they can be accessed by state() and name().
   - The device construction macros can now be removed. Changes to the core will not need to be reflected in constructors.
   - Change truth table macros so that going forward NETLIST_END and TRUTH_TABLE_END can be replaced by a closing curly brace.
      netlists can than use curly braces enclosed blocks.
   - more clang-format
   - removed some macros completely
   - all derived classes from base_device_t now don't use macros any longer.
   - as a result, delegator_t was removed. This class was only used to support macros :-(

 * Cleaned up the code for the SuperMac Spectrum cards, and fixed the garbage at the bottom of the screen on the Spectrum/8.
 * Put a layout with views for common monitor aspect ratios in a place where cards can use it.  This is especially useful for the
    NuBus cards that can support portrait monitors.
