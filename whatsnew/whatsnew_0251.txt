9278: ymdx100.cpp: Implemented most of the Yamaha DX100 emulation. [andlabs]
This change nearly fully implements and also promotes to working the Yamaha DX100 driver (`dx100`).
IMPERFECT_CONTROLS is due to the missing cassette port interface and other things still left as TODOs in the source.
IMPERFECT_SOUND has to do with the YM2164 emulation in ymfm not being implemented yet; it's still treated as equivalent to a YM2151,
  which is wrong. In fact, part of why I wanted to build this driver was to figure that out — the YM2164 has extra registers which
  are not used in any of the other devices that use the YM2164 that currently have any emulator but are used by the DX100. I'll
  contribute YM2164 emulation improvements to ymfm directly.
Thanks to Devin Acker for assistance.

9859: Moving environment variable substitution into core_options [npwoods]
This involves the following:
- Two new values were added to core_options::option_type:  `PATH` and `MULTIPATH`
- We now track subsituted and non-substituted values within options
- Many ad hoc calls to `osd_subst_env()` have been removed
- `osd_subst_env()` itself was changed to take an `std::string_view`, and return its result
Request for comments:  `PATH` and `MULTIPATH` are currently treated identically, but I attempted to break down every attribute
  properly for a future where we don't dictate usage of semicolons on non-Windows platforms.  MAME has an incredibly large amount of
  options, and I would like review to ensure that I got `STRING` vs `PATH` vs `MULTIPATH` correct

10572: 6x09 TFR / EXG Improvement [tlindner]
1. Remove tuple implementation used by the EXG and TFR instructions of the 6809, 6309 and Konami CPUs. It was unnecessary because
  fundamentally these are implemented with a single, 16 bit wide temporary register.
2. Changed how the 6809 CPU processes the invalid 8 to/from 16 bit register combinations. Their behavior now matches actual
  hardware. I used page 66 and 138 of Darren Atkinson's 6x09 manual [1] for reference. I also double checked with my own hardware
  [2].
3. Checked for regressions using NitrOS-9 (6809 and 6309) on the CoCo, And Aliens and 88Games (Konami).

10595: Support added for HP9825A & HP9831 [fulivi]
Hi,
this PR adds the support for HP9825A (B & T versions are already supported) and for the ultra-rare HP9831 (according to
  hpmuseum.net).
I've also added the emulation of HP9871 printer as a pass-through to a "printer" device. This printer is needed to see the output
  from 9831.
I'm going to mail all the relevant the ROM images shortly.
Thanks.

10614: konami/hornet.cpp, konami/cobra.cpp, konami/nwk-tr.cpp: Refactor JVS host code [987123879113]
I refactored the JVS host code I was using for these PowerPPC 4xx-based Konami machines into konppc_jvshost.cpp and made them use
  that instead of having 3 identical implementations. konppc.cpp already exists for "Konami PowerPC Common Functions" so I decided
  to use the same naming scheme since it applies to almost all of the same machines. konami/nwk-tr.cpp doesn't have anything hooked
  up to the JVS host but it was tested with the Master Calendar JVS device.
I also ripped out the old generic JVS I/O device code from konami/cobra.cpp and replaced it with a Windy2 I/O device, and fixed the
  bug stopping coins from working in bujutsu (cc: @angelosa).

10615: upd765.cpp: return a command_end with data_completion = false for failed commands [angelosa]

10617: konami/nwk-tr.cpp, konami/hornet.cpp: Rewrite GN676 LAN board and add variants for Thrill Drive, Racing Jam, Racing Jam 2
  [987123879113]
The commits are self contained so I recommend reading at the commit level at first.
Fixes MT07241.
The GN676 LAN board has been rewritten nearly from scratch. Thrill Drive can boot without the "skip post" dipswitch now as all boot
  tests are passing. I added a lot of documentation about this in the code but the games reprogram the FPGA at specific times
  depending on what it should be doing (boot memory test, security checks, etc) and I've tried my best to replicate the
  functionality based on the firmware that was uploaded. All games that use the board have been tested to make sure everything is
  working as expected. All known firmware versions for all games available currently have been documented as well. The actual
  networking has *not* been implemented but this should provide an accurate enough base for someone to be able to implement it in
  the future.
All possible regional and cabinet variants for Thrill Drive have been added and documented to the extent I could find major
  differences. The security chip data has been added for all NWK-TR Thrill Drive versions. The RTC chip is used to determine the
  cabinet type in Hornet Thrill Drive games whereas the security chip is used to determine cabinet type in NWK-TR Thrill Drive
  games.
Racing Jam and Racing Jam 2 has all regional variants added but only the GQ cabinet variants were added. The GQ cabinet type has the
  simplest I/O configuration and requires less hardware to be emulated. I've documented the differences between the cabinet types
  that I could find but I did not add them because the naming will just become increasingly more cryptic. I left a note on how to
  create working RTC files required for those cabinet types so it shouldn't be hard for someone to add them in the future. The
  cabinet type *does* change the user gameplay experience slightly.

10621: x68k_flop.xml: 12 new dumps from original disks, removed offsets [rzero9]
This adds 12 new X68000 dumps from original disks, mostly from protected games. They were dumped by krugman in SCP format
  (flux-level) and I converted them to the HxC MFM format so they can be used in MAME with the protection intact. As usual, the
  existing dumps have been renamed as "cracked" so they are still documented.
Also I took the opportunity to remove the "offset" attribute from the entire list, since there seems to be a consensus that it isn't
  needed for the floppy lists. I put it in a separate commit so it's easier to see the actual changes.

10625: konmedal.cpp: Corrected the K051649 clock for a few titles. [b0x-Cub3d]

  recordings.

10627: konami/hornet.cpp: Improvements to Silent Scope and Teraburst [987123879113]
- The Silent Scope's scope I/O board's ADC is hooked up where it should be so the game can boot without the machine init skip
  dipswitch enabled now.
~~- I added a hack for Silent Scope's scope screen to fix the screen update issue. I documented why the scope screen was broken and
  why the hack will fix it but I have no idea how to fix it properly so I'm hoping the hack + comment gives someone some leads to
  fix it properly in the future. The function of interest called by IRQ1 in `sscope` is 0x80008828 if someone wants to take a look
  at it.~~
- I hooked up controls to `gun_r` which allows Teraburst to work without the machine init skip dipswitch enabled and generally makes
  the game more playable (previously only had keyboard controls). It's an HLE style emulation instead of trying to implement the CCD
  camera setup.

10637: konami/hornet: Fix regression in Teraburst's gun I/O not passing boot test [987123879113]
Hornet games default to having the "skip post" dipswitch set to on because most games have issues during boot still, so I didn't
  notice when I broke the gun I/O's boot test in https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/10627. The two problems being that I
  completely forgot to fix returning m_gn680_ret0 and m_gn680_ret1 after I changed the functions from 32 bit to 16 bit, and also
  didn't take into account that gun I/O polling wants 0x7408000e to be set to 0.
Teraburst has a bunch of `[:voodoo0] internal_lfb_r: Buffer offset out of bounds x=486 y=1023 offset=000FFDE6 bufoffs=FFFB01E6`
  errors and eventually is reset by the watchdog so it's impossible to test if guns work skip post disabled.
Tested that the gun I/O check was passing again with skip post disabled, and also checked that the guns are still working by playing
  up to the car chase type scene on level 2 with "disable machine init" disabled.

10660: [VSMILE] machine configuration switches [KanedaFr]
Hi,
I added dipswitches to control 3 values of IOPortB.
ON and OFF switches allow to access BIOS test screen.
I first tried with classic inputs but since BIOS tests them on first ticks at launch, you can't press ON and OFF at the right time.
Based on this test screen, I was able to confirm every value of the language dipswitches.

* Channels 1 and 2 now use their level registers.

Sound emulation as a whole is still VERY inaccurate to real SM8521 behavior, but this can at least serve as a temporary fix until a
  proper implementation can be added.
The mixing itself also needs a bit of work at the moment before this can be considered for merging.

10682: sega/sms.cpp: Refactored Game Gear handling [cuavas]
* Use a memory view to switching between Game Gear and Master System compatibility I/O space mapping.  Got rid of most of the
  conditional code checking whether it's a Game Gear driver.
* Got rid of the special Game Gear EXT port slot.  It's the same thing as a Mega Driver controller/expansion I/O port with a
  different connector.
* sega/mdioport.cpp: Added a variant for the Game Gear with the TH/PC6 interrupt latch, and added it to the Game Gear.
There are still a couple of places it‘s checking for Game Gear in the function where it sets up cartridge mapping.
We need tests on real hardware to confirm details of behaviour when reading Game Gear built-in controls and EXT port in Master
  System compatibility mode.  Also need confirmation on whether it’s possible for TH input on the EXT port to latch the horizontal
  count in Master System compatibility mode – the main purpose on a Master System is to support light guns, which obviously don’t
  work on a Game Gear.
Opening as a pull request because I’m tired and don’t trust myself to push directly at the moment.

* Also fixed metadata on the other sets

10691: nintendo/playch10.cpp: Added separate gun trigger input. [0kmg]
- Also fixes incorrect Zapper-like trigger behavior. The PC10 trigger is just a button that fires upon being pushed. The NES trigger
  is a more complex mechanism where a full trigger motion pushes and then releases a micro switch (still not handled well in MAME as
  it generally means games fire when you _release_ a button).
For some reason (laziness?) P1's first button (B) was being repurposed for the light gun's trigger. Playchoice-10 has separate
  dedicated pins for both P1/P2 standard controls AND the light gun. All three happily coexist on hardware (unlike a light gun on a
  VS cabinet).

-iqunlim: Hooked up MC68EZ328 device. [Ryan Holtz]

10697: skeleton: Rename Vector 4 to Vector 3 [ejona86]
It appears Vector Graphic Monitor 4 was confused with Vector 4. The majority of the functioning parts are for the Vector 3, as that
  is the source of the ROMs.
I've fixed some of the easier Vector 4-isms that were copied from the user guide, but it will need more thorough work. That should
  be a lot easier with the better understanding of which machine was running and the detailed documentation.
------
I'm familiar with the Vector 4, but not so much with the Vector 3. I have a follow-up to add Vector 4. It doesn't conflict except
  for mame.lst.

10702: Yamaha DX9: Resolve issue with incoming MIDI clock [ajxs]
This PR resolves an issue with handling incoming MIDI on the Yamaha DX9 driver.
I made a mistake in my original analysis of the schematics. There's a divider on the 500 kHz crystal attached to the MIDI clock. I
  also forgot to finalise the reading of MIDI.
This PR should resolve those issues.

I thought this was maybe a manual misprint that didn't make the released versions. You always earn one life each time you make it to

 * Got rid of half a player 2 D-pad that was somehow polluting the Othello Multivision FG-2000.
 * Hooked up SF-7000 Centronics busy line to previously unused function.

-se3208: Add exception hook callback [AJR]

-ginganin: reduce 6840 clock [hap]

-sega/sg1000.cpp: SG-1000 only has one control port; prevent Othello Multivisions from segfaulting. (#10694) [0kmg]

-bus/sms_ctrl: Added support for Denpa XE-1AP controller. [Vas Crabb]
 * This is the "horsehoe crab" game pad version of the Denpa Micom Soft Analog/Digital Intelligent Controller System (the other
    version is the desktop "cyber stick").
 * Mega Drive games only support this controller in analog mode (the default).  Digital mode is designed to be used for games on
    computers with MSX-style controller ports that don't support analog controls.

-bus/sms_ctrl: A few refinements for the XE-1AP controller: [Vas Crabb]
 * Game pad version omits the fourth axis from the cyber stick.
 * Remumbered analog input ports to match documented channel names.
 * Improved notes.

-Update snes_slot.cpp (#10695) [Tom]

-machine/micomx1a.cpp: Slightly better timings. [Vas Crabb]

-m6809: rename *.ops to *.lst [hap]

-Software list-provided default option fixes [AJR]
 * Give "slot_default" option values default priority rather than maximum priority, so command line option specifications can
    override these
 * Silently ignore software list-provided default options or values that don't exist in a particular system configuration

-emuopts.cpp: Correction for 42adf5d51de36560547449c6c279a8df9df7dcfe [AJR]

-machine/micomxe1a.cpp: Fudged timings to work with buggy CRI games. [Vas Crabb]
 * CSK Research Institute games on FM Towns don't follow the same sequence as other games when reading inputs.  They depend on the
    data lines not being updated for some time after /Ack goes high, and can miss transitions if the timing is too tight (ironic
    that 16MHz '386 software has these issues when the 7MHz 6502 in the PC Engine gets by fine). This fudges the timings to work
    with the these buggy games without breaking the other use cases.
 * Also for some reason, these games expect an XE-1AP in MD mode with a Sega controller adapter - they won't work wth an XE-1AP in
    Personal Computer mode, and they won't work with the XE-1AJ or its NEC-branded relative.  In MAME you can flip the Interface
    setting to MD in the Machine Configuration options without needing to use an adapter device.

-machine/micomxe1a.cpp: Fixed a dumb editing error with delays. [Vas Crabb]

-globalfr: Back out fading effect, hardware doesn't support it (nw) [James Wallace]
