10676: nabupc: Support for the NABU PC computer system [brijohn]
This patch adds support for the NABU PC system from around 1982.
Most of the functionality are currently implemented, these include:

- Printer
- Bus support
- Floppy controller
- HCCA port/adapter
It is still missing emulation of the original native keyboard, but works with the serial HLE keyboard I wrote.

10724: sgi_mips: Three new software list additions [darkstar]
Three new Onyx2 demo CDs popped up on IA recently. This PR adds them to the `sgi_mips.xml` softlist.
They are "working" in a technical sense (standard ISO format, files can be installed/copied to an SGI running IRIX) but many of them
  don't run properly since they require an Onyx2 which I don't have/cannot test on/isn't emulated yet, so I'll add them as "not
  working".

reorganized the Pengo sets a little
- The Export versions are the versions with replaced music / faster maze drawing

- The unencrypted sets are the newest releases we have of both versions - for Japan that is ROMs 5120-5127 and for export that is
  ROMs 5128 - 5135 (suggesting these unencrypted versions were both released at the same time)

10761: Apple II double lo-res: work around issue #10760 [benrg]
This implements the same workaround for double lo-res that was already used for double hi-res: shift the whole image right by one
  pixel (losing the rightmost pixel) in monochrome mode so that the NTSC shader is happy. This doesn't affect color mode.
This rewrite incidentally fixes an incorrect shift count in the old code (see the issue).

YoYo Spell (prototype) [Opernet,  Recreativas.org, Museo del Recreativo]

10764: Remove a2_video_device::hgr_update_tk2000 [benrg]
It was not referenced anywhere in the source tree, and was just a copy of hgr_update with the address of page 2 changed from $4000
  to $A000. If support for this is ever needed, it could be handled by adding a parameter to hgr_update.

10765: upd765: unify data_irq and other_irq [cracyc]
The observed behavior of other_irq and data_irq appear to be the same where they are cleared by reading or writing the data
  register.  This implements that, using a pr to get some additional testing.

10766: Merge copies of text_update and plot_text_character in a2_video_device [benrg]
a2_video_device::{text_update,plot_text_character} already had a template parameter to distinguish II/II+ from IIe/IIc. Extending it
  enables {text_update,plot_text_character}{_ultr,_jplus,GS} to be merged in as well.
I preserved all of the logic of the old functions even where I suspect it's wrong. Behavior that seems suspicious to me: not masking
  by 0x3f on II/II+ (isn't their character ROM only 0.5K?); logic for the range 60..7f on IIe/c not applied on GS; and inconsistent
  use of m_aux_mask in aux_page accesses.
One exception to the previous paragraph: text_update_{jplus,ultr} didn't calculate startcol and stopcol, which seems to be just a
  missed optimization opportunity, and they tested row <= stoprow instead of row < stoprow, which is a bug that would make them emit
  25 lines instead of 24. I removed those differences.
This commit doesn't merge the screen_update_* functions, but they should also be merged.

10767: Remove a2_video_device::m_dhires_artifact_map [benrg]
m_dhires_artifact_map was just a rotate-four-bits-by-2 lookup table. The code that used it was already doing four-bit rotations by
  arbitrary amounts, so it is slightly simplified by eliminating the table.

10771: wy50: add beep [goldnchild]
I was using the wy50 with nabu cp/m and thought I'd try to add the beeper.  
I don't know the proper frequency of the wy50 beeper so I made a port_changed_member so you could adjust the beeper clock from the
  slider controls menu.

10773: Improved Apple II hires graphics color simulation [benrg]
The current color algorithm uses a 3-bit sliding window over the 280 bits of each scan line to determine the color of the center
  pixel, with bit 7 of the middle bit's byte as an auxiliary input.
This algorithm decodes the scan line to 560 bits in the same way as the hardware (and MAME's monochrome modes) and uses a 7-bit
  sliding window on the decoded bits. The result is the same as before if all high bits are clear. If high bits are set, the output
  is shifted right by one pixel as it should be, and the unique artifact colors at the boundaries between bytes with opposite high
  bits are simulated. (For more about those colors see page 8-20 of Understanding the Apple II by Jim Sather.)
The monochrome modes are rewritten to use the same decoding logic, which incidentally fixes some bugs: the left pixel of a 14-pixel
  group was not updated at 0-to-1 bit-7 transitions (leaving old pixels on the screen), the test against cliprect was incorrect, and
  m_dhires was ignored.

10776: casio/ctk551.cpp: better default velocity controls [devinacker]
This just cleans up some input definitions and gives the key velocity control some different inc/dec key defaults that don't
  interfere with actual directional buttons. Also fixed a minor element positioning issue in the ctk530 layout that I forgot to
  include originally.

10777: Merge copies of Apple II screen_update function [benrg]
Following the merge of `text_update` and `plot_text_character` (93500d7), this merges `apple2_state::screen_update{,_jp,_ultr}`,
  `apple2e_state::screen_update`, and `a2_video_device::screen_update_GS_8bit` into a single function in `a2_video_device`.
The only complication was that when I merged the IIe function that tested `apple2e_state::m_80store` into the IIGS function that
  tested `a2_video_device::m_80store`, it didn't work properly on IIe, because the IIGS driver updated the latter variable but the
  IIe driver ignored it and it was always false. I took the safest way out and copied the code from the IIGS driver to the IIe
  driver, but it would probably be better to pass the page number as a parameter.

10781: hd6309: Fix STBT instruction [tlindner]
This is a weird instruction that can copy a bit from a register to a memory location.
Previously it was not reading the value of the memory of the location before modifying it.

10782: Improve NTSC parameter descriptions and ranges in OSD [benrg]
Correct units of some parameters (they are MHz, not Hz) and correct one default (color carrier should be 3.57 MHz, not 35.7). Use a
  step size of 1/8800 MHz for the color carrier so that the NTSC value of 315/88 MHz can be exactly represented (to float
  precision). Add some units and change some ranges.
There are still some discrepancies in defaults and ranges between d3dhlsl.cpp and hlsl.json. I don't know which values make more
  sense.

10784: technos/ddragon.cpp: Added Double Dragon II layer priority PROM to clones [jotego]
Double Dragon II clones (and alternate versions) are missing one of the PROMs in the ROM section. I have checked that the systems
  work correctly using the same dump as in ddragon2.
In this commit, I have added that PROM to the ROM section. This matches what other drivers do in these circumstances. The comments
  suggest that a better dump may exist (although I doubt it).

10792: Better Apple II artifact color table [benrg]
Replace the "old" (committed just a few days ago) artifact color lookup table, which was designed in a somewhat ad-hoc way for hires
  graphics only, with a table based on simpler rules that can be used in any Apple II (not GS) video mode, though at the moment it
  is still used only for hires. Move it upward in the file in anticipation of other uses.
The only visible effect of this commit should be that the hires bit pattern ...1100100... (after expansion to 560 pixels), and one's
  complements and reflections of that, produce a medium color for the middle pixel, while in the old table it was a light/dark
  color. This is an unusual corner case, the new color is about as reasonable as the old, and both are more accurate than the
  behavior before the commit of a few days ago.

10793: SPARC and sun4 fixes and boilerplate cleanup [MooglyGuy]

10796: vsmile: fix swap between off and on buttons [KanedaFr]
I made a mistake between ON and OFF buttons on last commit

10797: Apple II: fix Video-7 RGB card double hi-res modes [benrg]
Fix an off-by-1 error in the 160-column mode that caused the rightmost 2 pixels to be omitted. In 140-column color and mixed modes,
  use custom logic to make 140 wide pixels instead of simulating blurry artifact color. In mixed mode, each high bit controls 7
  narrow pixels according to the manual.
With these changes, the card seems to pass all of the tests on the official demo disk, except that foreground-background hires
  remains unimplemented, "Color Mouse Draw" seems to hang/crash, and some demos sometimes set the wrong mode when run after other
  demos (including themselves). The last could be a bug in the demos.

10798: apple2gs.cpp: make kmstatus match observed IIgs behavior; [ksherlock]
* mouse data register is full until both x/y are read
* X/Y bit set after X is read, cleared after Y is read
* X/Y bit was accidentally dependent on the KGS_ANY_KEY_DOWN bit

10806: Separate Apple II video config from system config [benrg]
Add a `a2_video_config` port to contain the monitor type (with the idea of adding other settings later), and add some private
  accessors to avoid magic numbers. This incidentally fixes a bug in `apple2` and `apple2cp` which had another configuration field
  that overlapped with the monitor-type field. On the IIc+, setting 80-column mode would make the video system think a IIe RGB card
  was installed.

10808: cpu/arcompact - rewrote core [DavidHaywood]

10809: Make all clients of a2_video_device use screen_update [benrg]
The superga2 and tk2000 drivers called hgr_update directly. Instead set the appropriate mode and call screen_update, and make
  hgr_update private along with the other mode-specific functions.

10810: taito/taito_f2.cpp: Use screen_vblank_partial_buffer_delayed for Mega Blast (MT08543) [DavidHaywood]
Fixes MT08543 – megablst and clones: Shield powerup aura on option is missing.
Many other games in the driver use `m_screen->screen_vblank().set(FUNC(taitof2_state::screen_vblank_partial_buffer_delayed));` and
  there's a long explanation about the game software and how they buffers things and why it is needed in those cases.  I don't know
  why it wasn't set for this game however, so please check for new issues elsewhere.

10870: ncr53c90: Add NCR53CF96 + bugfixes [987123879113]
Discussion can be found in this commit: https://github.com/mamedev/mame/commit/8518c8421555e9ad7443e4537ea02ed6d4f4c441#r98926600
Basic NCR53CF96 was added in preparation for an upcoming PR to convert the Konami arcade drivers using AM53CF96 to use NSCSI.
The nscsi/cd change is required to fix sun4_60 booting because Solaris 2.6 requests 48 bytes from the SCSI INQUIRY command but only
  receives the hardcoded 36 bytes, so it would time out waiting for the remaining data.

http://archive.6502.org/datasheets/rockwell_r6522_via.pdf
state that:
The IFR bit 7 is not a flag. Therefore, this bit is not directly cleared by writing a logic 1 into it. It can only be cleared by
  clearing all the flags in the register or by disabling all the active interrupts as discussed in the next section.
but this is what current code does. If more updated datasheets are available, please share the links.

10891: hng64.cpp: Hyper NeoGeo 64 video updates [DavidHaywood]
- filter out most (but not all) the bad polygons in roadedge / xrally by handling display list more correctly
- fixed 4bpp texture handling (they were being treated as 'low resolution' textures, throwing away 3/4 of the data) (used
  extensively for background details on sams64/sams64_2)
- added 4bpp texture decode for easy viewing of the 4bpp texture pages, handy for debugging
- fixed some texture palette issues connected to the 4bpp textures and incorrect enable bits being used (wheels+windscreen palette
  in racing games for example)
- found a flag which seems to enable/disable the backface culling, improves bbust2 school bus without breaking roadedge
- a few small tidyups / cleanups (disabled some printf/logerrors that would be heavily spammed at times)
- add ADK as the developer of bbust2 (SNK/ADK is credited in the ending, even if not on the title screen)

10904: misc/gfamily.cpp: Re-encoded the CHD from the GHO the right way [Recreativas.org] [clawgrip]
The HDD CHD boots fine. The procedure used to create the CHD from the Norton Ghost image was: 
1.- Use Norton Ghost to convert from GHO to VHD using the 'ntexact' option. 
2.- Use QEmu to convert from VHD to raw.
3.- Use chdman to convert from raw to CHD.

10905: hng64_v.cpp : added some missing Hyper NeoGeo 64 video features [DavidHaywood]
- enabled additive blending in certain situations where it improves the visuals
- prevent background colour flickering in sams64/sams64_2 due to using wrong register bit
- added mosaic effect for tilemaps

-andromed: add coinage dipswitch [hap]

-Merge copies of text_update and plot_text_character in a2_video_device (#10766) [benrg]
 * a2_video_device::{text_update,plot_text_character} already had a template parameter to distinguish II/II+ from IIe/IIc. Extending
    it enables {text_update,plot_text_character}{_ultr,_jplus,GS} to be merged in as well.

-Remove a2_video_device::m_dhires_artifact_map (#10767) [benrg]
 * m_dhires_artifact_map was just a rotate-four-bits-by-2 lookup table. The code that used it was already doing four-bit rotations
    by arbitrary amounts, so it is slightly simplified by eliminating the table.

-macadb: added the Ins/Del keys and fixed some keypad keys.  [R. Belmont, Kelvin Sherlock]

-apple2gs: workaround for Finder thinking the mouse button is initially stuck down. [R. Belmont]

-upd765: unify data_irq and other_irq (#10765) [cracyc]

-distate: max_length() has no use for value() either [hap]

-Improved Apple II hires graphics color simulation (#10773) [benrg]
 * This algorithm decodes the scan line to 560 bits in the same way as the hardware (and MAME's monochrome modes) and uses a 7-bit
    sliding window on the decoded bits. The result is the same as before if all high bits are clear. If high bits are set, the
    output is shifted right by one pixel as it should be, and the unique artifact colors at the boundaries between bytes with
    opposite high bits are simulated. (For more about those colors see page 8-20 of Understanding the Apple II by Jim Sather.)
 * The monochrome modes are rewritten to use the same decoding logic, which incidentally fixes some bugs: the left pixel of a
    14-pixel group was not updated at 0-to-1 bit-7 transitions (leaving old pixels on the screen), the test against cliprect was
    incorrect, and m_dhires was ignored.

-pinball/by35.cpp: redumped sound ROM for suprbowl [inkochnito, PinMAME]

-Merge copies of Apple II screen_update function (#10777) [benrg]
 * Following the merge of text_update and plot_text_character (93500d7), this merges apple2_state::screen_update{,_jp,_ultr},
    apple2e_state::screen_update, and a2_video_device::screen_update_GS_8bit into a single function in a2_video_device.

-Apple II double lo-res: work around issue #10760 (#10761) [benrg]
 * This implements the same workaround for double lo-res that was already used for double hi-res: shift the whole image right by one
    pixel (losing the rightmost pixel) in monochrome mode so that the NTSC shader is happy. This doesn't affect color mode.

-ui: Give menus an opportunity to recompute metrics on window resize. [Vas Crabb]
 * Also reworked calculation of menu geometry in general, and limited width of left panel on system/software selection menus.
 * Fixes images in the right panel and icons on the system/software selection menus not being scaled correctly when the window is
    resized (MT08539 is an example of this).
 * Fixes bad font size selection at low resolutions when using bitmap fonts like uismall.bdf (GitHub #7105).
 * Fixes collapse/expand arrows on left/right panels of system/softwre selection menus getting bigger if the window is made
    narrower.

-tubep: remove some tag lookups [hap]

-abc1600: Connect BUS0X PRAC callback, and break into debugger on bus error. [Curt Coder]

-More UI cleanup: [Vas Crabb]
 * Got rid of more UI globals.
 * Cache more metrics in system/software selection menus.
 * Don't lose a BDF font specified on the command line when changing font size via the UI.
 * For win32 debugger, behave as though most recent history item was just entered when restoring session state.

-osd: Better XInput and SDL game controller input enhancements: [Vas Crabb]
 * Added initial support for XInput controller subtypes, starting with driving, arcade and flight controllers.
 * Check XInput capabilities to ignore buttons and hats that aren't present.
 * Added preliminary SDL Game Controller joystick provider.  Reconnection and mixed Game Controller/Joystick devices are
    unsupported.
 * Show the input token for the highlighted control on input device menus.

-ui: Allow menus to set required space above and below menu when metrics change.  Fixes the initial bad layout on the system
 selecton menu, or bad layout after resizing windows. [Vas Crabb]

 * Allow fallback to joystick API for devices without game controller mappings.
 * Detect controller reconnection.
 * Force Switch Pro Controller ZL/ZR to act like buttons.
 * Added button names for Google Stadia controller.
 * Also fixed dumb copy/paste error on my part in Windows clipboard code.

-osd: Added support for mapping files to sdlgame joystick provider and made it default with SDL. [Vas Crabb]
 * This changes behaviour, however I think it's a net positive:
   - Most games using Steam Input or SDL2 to read game controllers have this behaviour, so users have come to expect it.
   - This module is better at giving meaningful names to buttons on common controller, and assigning axes consistently.
   - Button/axis mapping files using a widely-used format are supported.
   - The old behaviour is still available with `-joystickprovider sdljoy` if anyone wants it.
     * The new option for controller mapping files is in the general OSD options rather than SDL options as it can be extended to
        DirectInput in the future.

-gladiatr: patch mcu roms to fix coin issue [hap]

-Miscellaneous fixes and refactoring: [Vas Crabb]
 * ui/analogipt.cpp: Fixed bar graph display for fields with ranges that wrap through zero.
 * emu/inputdev.cpp: Separateed analog axis deadzone and switch threshold settings, reduced default deadzone, and fixed a potential
    division by zero if the deadzone and saturation settings are equal.
 * emu/ioport.cpp: Fixed behaviour of absolute analog fields where range passes through zero - it previously only worked for
    specific combinations of mask, minimum and default.  Removed a workaround from universal/getaway.cpp that is no longer
    necessary.
 * emu/input.cpp: Fixed unintuitive behaviour when an absolute field is assigned an OR combination of a relative control folled by
    an absolute control (e.g. Mouse X or Joy 1 LSX).  Also fixed reading axis input sequences where an axis code is followed by a
    switch code (these can only be produced by manually editing configuration files, not through MAME's UI), and fixed the returned
    type when multiple relative axes sum to zero.
 * osd/modules/input_dinput.cpp: Fixed hat switches being stuck in up position when input is suspended in the background
 * taito/taitoio_yoke.cpp: Give throttle control a distinct type, and don't auto-centre.
 * osd: Added option to select MIDI provider module (currently only PortMidi and the dummy module are available).  Also put various
    things in namespaces, and fixed builds including SDL sound module with native Windows OSD.
 * emu/validity.cpp: Added check to catch I/O port fields using UI input types.
 * emu/inpttype.ipp: Renamed inputs that were causing confusion.  "Bill" and "Track" were causing confusion for translators and
    hence likely causing confusion for many users, especially those who are not native English speakers.  "Track" as an abbreviation
    for "Trackball" was frequently being mistranslated, e.g. in the sense of a CD track selection button or even in the sense of a
    railway track.  There's no reason to abbreviate it.  "Bill" in the US English sense as a banknote is too ambiguous and was
    causing confusion for translators.  It's better to use the less ambiguous "Banknote".  Corrected Greek translations of
    "Trackball".
 * Don't run GitHub Actions on issue template changes.

Primus Expert mit Stimme [Team Europe]

-Various input and OSD refactoring: [Vas Crabb]
 * osd: Supply OSD object to modules on initialisation.  Encapsulated some event handling in the OSD objects rather than leaving it
    in free functions.  Put various stuff in namespaces.
 * osd/modules/input: Enabled dinput, xinput and winhybrid modules for Windows SDL builds, and enabled background input for dinput
    and xinput (and by extension winhybrid) modules.  Also fixed some COM and X11 resource leaks.
 * osd/modules/input/input_sdl.cpp: Flipped SDL mouse button order to match Windows, and exposed vertical and horizontal scroll as Z
    and rZ axes. Moved SDL UI event handling out of input devices into OSD object.
 * osd/modules/input_rawinput.cpp: Changed lightgun Z axis token so it's correctly identified as a relative axis (it maps to the
    scroll wheel equivalent).
 * osd: Added an option to choose the network provider module.  Mostly useful if you build with both TUN/TAP and pcap support
    included, or if you want to disable emulated networking completely.
 * emu/input.cpp: Use a better strategy for assembling input code names that uses fewer temporary strings and doesn't require use of
    the non-Unicode-aware space trimming function (fixes MT08552).
 * osd/modules/input_dinput.cpp: Improved polling logic.
 * osd: Made various parts of the input code less dependent on concrete emu objects, and reduced inappropriately passing around the
    machine object. Made input modules less dependent on OSD implementation.  Encapsulated some stuff and got rid of some vestigial
    newui and SDL1 support code. Cleaned up some interfaces.  Moved OSD options classes to their own files.
 * Prepare to remove main.h from emu.h - it's mostly used to get the application name, which the vast majority of emulated devices
    don't need to do.

-osd/modules/input: Fixed Linux build. [Vas Crabb]

-pinball/inder.cpp: Fix date in note about "Mundial 90". (#10851) [ClawGrip]

-Major D3D and BGFX code refactoring and bug fixes: (#10858) [Ryan Holtz]
 * render/bgfx: Improved clearing and blending. Added prescale support. Fixes MT07586, MT07587, MT08084.
 * render/bgfx: Fixed blend and tint handling. (Fixes Github #1953).
 * render/bgfx/blendreader.cpp: Support non-separated blend mode specification for BGFX effects.
 * render/bgfx: Reworked how horizontally-padded screen textures are handled. Likely fixes MT08512 and MT08505.
 * render/bgfx: Ensure that a texture's width margin is updated in all cases.
 * render/d3d/d3dhlsl.cpp: Fixed tinting in HLSL post-processing mode.
 * render/d3d/d3dhlsl.cpp: Avoid most redundant state-setting calls. Reduces D3D API calls by about 90% on fruit machine drivers.
 * render/d3d/d3dhlsl.cpp: Assign SourceDims and QuadDims uniforms to only those effects that use them.
 * machine/laserdsc.cpp: Always add video quad to screen container, adjust tint based on m_videoenable instead.

-render/bgfx: Got rid of a lot of unnecessary object copying during setup. [Vas Crabb]

-osd: Turned video modules into actual modules, fixed various issues. [Vas Crabb]
 * Don't ignore the return status of OSD module initialisation.  Attempt to fall back to an alternate module if the selected module
    fails to initialise.  Log more useful diagnostic information at verbose level.
 * Fixed BGFX crash on exit after toggling fullscreen.  Also persist more settings than just the selected chains across toggling
    fullscreen.
 * Turned video modules into OSD modules in the same sense as all the other OSD modules.  They now use the same selection/fallback
    mechanism as all the other modules without special extra code in the OSD implementations.
 * Untangled some object ownership mess.  Windows own renderers, OSD objects own windows.  Fixed a refrence loop that caused the
    first window object to always leak.
 * Don't create renderer object until after underlying window has been created.  Fixed issues with order of creation/destruction
    when toggling fullscreen or changing prescale in fullscreen with -switchres in SDL builds.
 * Use more smart pointers in BGFX and Direct3D render modules.  Most of the code now reutrns a smart pointer when handing over
    ownership or a naked pointer when retaining ownership.  Fixed a few leaks and simplified cleanup code.
 * Encapsulated various OSD modules better.

 * Correctly persist settings across fullscreen toggle when explicit screen chains are configured.
 * If chains are specified for a single window only, apply them to all windows.
 * Treat empty string for screen chain as "default" rather than crashing.
 * Changed default setting for bgfx_screen_chains to an empty string so chain selection will be saved/restored per system with
    mame.ini file created by -cc with no other settings.

-msx2_cart.xml: Fix incorrect sha1s on msxdos2 floppy images. (#10902) [wilbertpol]

-imacg3.cpp, powermacg3.cpp: added Cuda, MacADB, and DIMM serial presence detect readback.  [R. Belmont]

-isa/np600: Guess functions of various things [AJR]

-Input refactoring: [Vas Crabb]
 * osd/modules/input, emu/inpttype.cpp: Made most default joystick assignments supplied by input modules.  Input modules take
    available controls into consideration when generating default assignments.
 * emu/inpttype.ipp: Added a separate "Back" UI input separate from Cancel. You may want an easier to hit combination for moving to
    the previous menu than for exiting or cancelling input.  They both default to Escape.
 * emu/inpttype.ipp: Added a UI Help control.  Currently only used by analog inputs menu
 * emu/inpttype.h: Moved I/O port field type enum to its own header and sorted UI controls so they appear in a more logical order.
 * ui: Don't use UI Select to restore defaults - people should be getting used to the UI Clear input by now.  UI Select cycles
    multi-value items instead.
 * ui/inputmap.cpp: Don't use immediate cancel to cycle between clearing and restoring default assignment (use UI Clear instead).
 * osd: Reduced the number of files needing to include the dreaded emu.h. Got some implementation out of headers.
