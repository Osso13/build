8653: bgfx crt-geom and crt-geom-deluxe improvements [cgwg]
In addition to some reduction of duplicate code, there are two improvements:
1. In crt-geom-deluxe, the Gaussian blur used for the halation uses more taps, allowing a wider blur.
2. The sRGB gamma ramp has been added as an option and made the default. This should reduce the long trails of phosphor persistence
  reported by some users.
As usual, I can't generate the full set of shader targets, so someone with Windows would have to do that.

9651: sgi_mips: add some more missing discs from archive.org [darkstar]
Recently some more missing discs from IRIX 6.5.4 and 6.5.5 have surfaced on archive.org, as well as some hardware patch discs and
  multiple versions of the SGI O2 out-of-box-experience.
I only added the new discs (which makes integrating them into the CHD set straightforward), although I propose one additional
  renaming step:
* rename the existing `o2_oobe` softlist entry to `o2_oobe_2_1` as that is the actual version (can be checked by searching the
  uncompressed CHD for the strin `OutOfBox Experience`), to be in-line with the other entries
* rename the (new) `o2_oobe_96` softlist entry to `o2_oobe` (as that one does not have any verison identifier)

9922: Created a CBM DOS file system driver and added it to the 1541 implementation [npwoods]
For now, the driver only supports reading

9952: machine/z80scc.cpp: Implement /W//REQ on receive and /DTR//REQ on transmit [briceonk]
This change adds support for using /W//REQ as the RX DMA pin, as well as the /DTR//REQ pin as the TX DMA pin. This allows software
  that uses both directions simultaneously to function (like Sony NEWS-OS 4.2.1aRD's `esccf` driver on the NWS-5000 series, which
  uses these pins in conjunction with one of its CXD8442Q WSC-FIFO chips for async serial communication) .
Note - the ESCC user manual mentions that the /W//REQ and /DTR//REQ pins don't depend on the transmitter enable status, but that is
  not how the driver was originally coded, so I didn't touch that part, but with this code, /DTR//REQ will not consider the
  transmitter enable flag to match the spec:

9999: mpu4.cpp - set more likely extender boards for a number of mpu4 sets, based on how they're used [DavidHaywood]
- allows more games to light all their lamps
- fixed(?) large extender hookup so that all lamps light, eg. m4andybt
- gave m4andybt better inputs (is mostly playable now, but some 7segs in the display still aren't hooked up)
- move some sets to mpu4mod2 and mpu4mod4yam based on sound chip use

10001: jpmsru.cpp: Added Lucky Casino DAC [SomeRandomGuyIdk]

 - fixes led extender strobes, allows output to be inverted

10016: nld_dm9314.cpp: add RS mode to netlist 9314 [goldnchild]
In working on the gtrak10, the score will count up to 8 and won't go up to 10, I believe because the 9314 doesn't have RS mode
  enabled.  With this fix, the score works and the zeroes propagate upwards from QA to QB to QC to QD since the output bits are
  hooked up to the next stage Data in (Q0 -> D1, Q1-> D2, Q2->D3)
S Bar is high, Data goes low -> supposed to clear the bit

	TTL_74192(B8, GROUND, GROUND, GROUND, P, GROUND, START_Q, BUSES_COUNT_UP, P)  // FIXME: HACK to test buses
#else
	TTL_74192(B8, GROUND, GROUND, GROUND, P, GROUND, START_Q, A8_2.Q, P)
#endif
#ifdef STUNT_CYCLE_HORIZ_COUNT_HACK
	TTL_7486_XOR(B2_2, DIRECTION_Q, C2_2.Q)  // FIXME HACK: this should be a 7400 NAND, horizontal counting isn't quite working
  properly.  Leftward movement isn't working.
	// without this hack, the bike never will make it down to the ramp level
	// with this hack, the bike will move through the second level very quickly
#else
	TTL_7400_NAND(B2_2, DIRECTION_Q, C2_2.Q)  // correct chip is a NAND

Was trying a circuit with TTL_74157_DIP and it gave 
error../../../../../src/lib/netlist/devices/nlid_truthtable.cpp:587: output count not matching

10074: vectrex: Pass the new value with the timer param, so it ends up in the y integrator. [ElectricMagic]
In commits ca79d71af4b and then 1efbdbf8055, `mame/machine/vectrex.cpp` and `mame/video/vectrex.cpp` changed how the value from via
  PORTA reaches the mux output with the requisite 8.5us delay.
An unwanted result is that the value _currently_ on PORTA at the time the delay expires is what ends up in the destination, rather
  than the value that had been in place when the delay started. The effect is that in some circumstances the Y integrator operates
  with the current X value, to produce output in the game Thrust like this, whereas it should look like this.

This problem was identified because the file system didn't properly show up when the 'c64' driver was run, and this seems to be the
  correct fix.  The part of this that confuses me is that if this defect was preventing the CBMDOS fs from showing up under c64, why
  don't the CoCo file systems have the same problem?  Both fs_coco_rsdos.cpp and fs_coco_os9.cpp specify (seemingly incorrectly)
  SSDD.

Source changes
--------------
New working clones
------------------
Tetris + Cherry Master (Corsica, v8.01, encrypted) [Ioannis Bampoulas]

-Reduced project cross-dependencies, slightly improved renaming script. [Vas Crabb]

-Rearrange source to match project structure (done using the script in src/tools). [Vas Crabb]

-Eliminated cross dependencies between driver projects. [Vas Crabb]
 * Driver projects now use globs to search for files.  There's less effort editing the Lua files when things are moved around.
    Remember it won't automatically pick up a change, so if you add/remove/change files, you should touch makefile to get it to find
    the change.
 * Driver projects no longer get the top-level MAME directory as an include path.  This means you need to think about how you
    structure things and not introduce nasty circular dependencies.
 * Subtarget projects can now be generated entirely from .flt files without the need for separate Lua scripts and .lst files.  This
    has been done for the arcade, mess and virtual targets.  It effectively works like a SOURCES= build on a large scale.  This
    means you need to organise things so the dependency genrators can find them.
 * There's an issue with the mess subtarget right now.  For some reason, decmate2.cpp isn't picking up the dependency on the PDP8
    CPU core for the HD6120 device.  I'll debug it later

-Converted nl subtarget to use a filter rather than a script and driver list. [Vas Crabb]

-Add M68HC11 internal EEPROM for relevant models [AJR]

-bellybmbr: Fix ROM loading [AJR]

-Added make opions for filter file, adjusted source path display. [Vas Crabb]
 * Added SOURCEFILTER option to specify a driver filter file in your make options, e.g. like make SUBTARGET=custom
    SOURCEFILTER=mydrivers.flt (or put it in your useroptions.mak if you'll be using it a lot).  It functions more-or-less like
    SOURCES on steroids.
 * Changed the way system/device source file paths are displayed to suit the new source layout better.  INI file loading hasn't
    changed, that still just uses the base file name.
 * Added overlooked trigger to src/bus.lua to include NES controller bus if the NES zapper sensor is needed.

-Prevent src/devices from inadvertently including headers from src/mame. (#9996) [Miodrag Milanović]

-30test.cpp, skeetsht.cpp: Remove EEPROM areas from external maps [AJR]

-More quality of life features for new source layout: [Vas Crabb]
 * Added support for wildcards in .flt filter files.  You'll need to quote them to avoid /* being parsed as a comment initiator,
    like "seta/*.cpp" on a line including the quotes.
 * Added an XSLT filter for listing system driver sources, like mame -lx | xsltproc scripts/xslt/list-system-sources.xslt
 * Converted the ci subtarget (which isn't really used much) into a .flt rather than .lua and .lst files.

 * gave m4andybt better inputs (is mostly playable now, but some 7segs in the display still aren't hooked up)

-emu: Fixed issues with memory views and snapshot naming. [Vas Crabb]
 * Include device tag in memory view save item registration names.  Without this, instantiating two of the same device (or two
    devices with identically named memory views) causes a fatal error on start.
 * Fixed -aviwrite/-mngwrite with -snapview native more than two screens. Previously it would attempt to use the same file name for
    all screens but the first.
 * Improved naming of snapshots, especially when using -snapview native with -aviwrite/-mngwrite (see GitHub #10005).  The
    automatically included screen number should come before the extension if supplied. Also, assume that users actually know what
    they’re doing if they include a dot in a snapshot filename pattern.

 * Implemented more CRTC registers, getting to the point where System 6.0.8 and System 7.0.1 will show video on NTSC and PAL
    displays with approximately correct interrupt timings.  Also implemented 1:2:1 convolutions (this blurs the image vertically -
    in real life it reduces interlace flicker).
 * Screen update in interlaced modes isn't right yet - it updates every line on every frame, and there's a vertical offset caused by
    the initial half-line.

 * This problem was identified because the file system didn't properly show up when the 'c64' driver was run, and this seems to be
    the correct fix.  The part of this that confuses me is that if this defect was preventing the CBMDOS fs from showing up under
    c64, why don't the CoCo file systems have the same problem?  Both fs_coco_rsdos.cpp and fs_coco_os9.cpp specify (seemingly
    incorrectly) SSDD.

-a2600.cpp: Default to having a right joystick connected. (#10040) [0kmg]

 * Param now holds a value and a destination, so that we write the value that existed at send time, rather than whatever's in PORTA
    when receipt occurs.  Fixes 45° vectors in Thrust and Moon Lander (and presumably others).

 * atari/a2600.cpp: Remove device lookups.

 * Added descriptions for several more "useful" settings.
 * Bumped documentation version as the build system changes are not in 0.245.

-Minor cleanup and fixes. [Vas Crabb]
 * apple2_flop_clcracked.xml: Turned some comments that are apparently supposed to be usage notes into info elements.
 * konami/mogura.cpp: Made PROM-to-palette mapping more obvious using bitswap.

-apple2_flop_clcracked.xml: fixed typo [Ivan Vangelista]

-More minor cleanup. [Vas Crabb]

-Clean up whitespace with srcclean [Vas Crabb]
