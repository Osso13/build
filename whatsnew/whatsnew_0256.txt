11267: gameboy.xml: Software list addition [ICEknigh7]
New partly working entry:
- Debagame Tester: Second Impact (Ver 10.24) [gameboycamera.com, LuigiBlood]
!image
Also fixed entry for `Bart Simpson's Escape from Camp Deadly (Japan) [bartescj]`, which apparently didn't load due to not having a
  slot type assigned.

11273: dragon_cart.xml: Entry replaced with good dump, added additional info from PCB, updated softlist to new standards [ICEknigh7]
Modified software list formatting with the new standards.
Also added this entry:
- Cyrus Chess [Clawgrip, ICEknight]
PCB has two EPROMs, previous entry had been dumped as one ROM. The new dumps come from reading the EPROMs directly.
And finally, added more info to entry for "Test de conducción", based on PCB pics.

11276: heathkit/h89.cpp add support for z37 soft-sector controller [mgarlanger]
Adding the z37 soft-sectored floppy disk controller for the Heath H89.
Note: I think I connected everything properly, but this is not currently working. I'm putting up a PR to potentially get some help.
  From debugging, it appears that it is getting to the point of waiting for DRQ signal for reading in the sector, but instead of
  getting a DRQ, it is getting an INTRQ..

Happy Video [jordigahan, Recreativas.org]

11295: video/epic12: Apply clipping to Blitter calculations as well [buffis]
Fix issue where some games do very large over-draws which when utilized in Blitter calculations will cause more delay than whats
  seen on hardware. The fog in S1 of Mushi Futari 1.5 is a good example of this.
On Mushi Futari 1.5, in the section before the boss, the Blitter delay seen on PCB is aprox 12 milliseconds at peaks. With this fix,
  it matches that quite well!
It's not 100% clear to me this is exactly how things behave, but this should be closer to the truth, until I can figure out a more
  reliable and reproducible test-case.
See discussions on this PR for background : https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/11227
For reference, Saleae logic analyzer output is available in: http://img.buffis.com/misc/futaris.sal

11296: atari/atarist.cpp: (ste) don't segfault immediately when starting up [ksherlock]
`ste`, etc, use `m_videox` instead of `m_video`, which causes a segfault.

11299: Cleanup of Markham.cpp documentation [ToastmanJack]
Resubmission of #11294 since I renamed my branch to something more fitting, this removes the games list from the headers in
  markham.cpp, markham.h and markham_v.cpp and instead only specifies the Hardware supported by the driver.

11302: namco/namcos10: Add Taiko no Tatsujin RT: Nippon no Kokoro [987123879113]
The CD wasn't properly imaged in the past when the dumper had access to it in the past so all we have is a recreated CD image made
  using the loose files that were available due to the rarity of this version and lack of other options currently. I've left a
  comment explaining such in the driver and marked it as `BAD_DUMP`. The game does some small checks on the CD to make sure it's the
  right CD and it accepts the image without issue. Taiko RT only has 20 songs in total so I tested every song to make sure the CD
  image was playable with music until the end.
Also, I made sure to clear the EEPROM section in 8e this time. It'll show "first power on" on the first boot and have the default
  settings.

11303: psikyo.cpp: Accurate measurements for remaining (non-bootleg) games [buffis]
I went ahead and verified that Gunbird uses the exact same timings as Strikers 1945 and Tengai, so it should be safe to use them for
  everything with this driver.
I left the Bootleg as-is though, since I dont know what that hardware looks like.
Gunbird also uses IPL2 for interrupts (Interrupt level 4), see pic below.

The heath/h89.cpp with a z37 soft-sectored controller uses IM0 and places an EI instruction on the bus when DRQ signal is received

11329: coco_fdc: Allow FLEX to work on CoCo machines [n6il]
There are two parts to the change.  First is a correction to the coco_fdc hardware emulation. Second is file format ordering
  adjustments wich make things easier for using FLEX on CoCos.
For the hardware change:  Before the change FLEX was unable to boot on CoCo machines.  The behaviour and troubleshooting showed that
  while the FLEX kernel started up it was unable to read anything from Track 0.  Standard FLEX disks have SD(FM) on Track 0, and the
  remainder of the disks (for CoCo FLEX) are normally DD(MFM) or could also be SD(FM).  The bug was in the handling of the WDC FDC's
  INTRQ line.  Reviewing the available documentation and schematics showed that when the FDC asserts INTRQ two things happen.  NMI
  is asserted on the CoCo bus and the HALT signal is cleared.  The MAME code added an incorrect condition on clearing HALT: It only
  happened when Double-Density operation was selected.  This change fixes the logic to work the same way as is shown in the
  schematics, that HALT is cleared any time INTRQ is asserted. SD(FM) disk operations work properly and FLEX boots completely and
  runs correctly after making this change.
Color Computer Disk Cart FD502 26-3133 Schematic (Tandy) INTRQ HALT Logic.pdf
File Format Ordering Adjustments:  This part of the change makes it easiser to use FLEX in CoCo emulation with a wider variety of
  FLEX-formatted disk images.  The issue here is that due to the way the JVC disk format works it winds up being a catch-all for
  disk images.  Because FLEX has specific formatting requirements and code to handle this and JVC has no support for this special
  formatting, FLEX formats along with DMK and SDF are moved to come before JVC in the formats list.  This allows a wider variery of
  FLEX-formatted disk images to be properly detected.
The DMK disk image from the following recent restoration of FHL Color FLEX was used for testing:

11330: heath/h19.cpp Implement Shift-Reset functionality [mgarlanger]
The H19 allowed the user to press the right-shift and reset key to reset the system. Since the h89 shared the common terminal board
  in the H19, this reset also was routed to the h89 cpu board and reset the entire computer. The actual reset occurs on the release
  of the keys.
In mame, the default key for reset is F10. Using the right-shift and F10 now causes the machine (either H19 or H89) to be reset.
A few other general cleanup of comments, formatting, etc. is also done in this PR.

11333: Address some limitations of delegates and callbacks [cuavas]
This is mostly a response to comments from @rb6502 and @galibert.  This is split up into three commits to make it a bit easier to
  see what’s going on:
* The actual functional changes in src/emu (not possible to build as it lacks the corresponding updates to the rest of the code)
* Updating the rest of the code for the changes to devcb.h
* Hacks to make three devices I haven’t sorted out yet build
The big change answers the question, “Why does devcb have `resolve` as well as `resolve_safe`?” by making removing them both
  altogether.  This entails a number of changes:
* Device callbacks are now automatically resolved at the same time as object finders.
* Read callbacks now need a default return value specified at construction, whether you plan to use it or not.
* The `isnull()` accessor and cast to `bool` operator have been removed.
* There’s a new `isunset()` accessor that tells you if the callback wasn’t configured, even when it’s callable after being resolved.
I can think of arguments against this:
* You no longer have to make a conscious decision on whether you’re going to do things differently depending on whether the callback
  is configured or not.  Currently, if you use `resolve` you need to check that the callback is configured every time.  With this
  change you play fast and loose.
* You always need to supply a default return value for read callbacks, even if you’re going to check them with `isunset` every time
  and do something different if they aren’t configured.
This *does* make the code tidier, though:
* One less thing to remember to do when using device callbacks
* Many devices no longer need to implement `device_resolve_objects`
* Over 6,000 lines net reduction

11339: heath/h19.cpp Implement Shift-Reset functionality [mgarlanger]
Attempt 2 of implementing reset functionality for H19/H89 previous pr - https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/11330 was reverted.
  This PR address comments on the reverted one.
Original Info from reverted PR:
```
The H19 allowed the user to press the right-shift and reset key to reset the system. Since the h89 shared the common terminal board
  in the H19, this reset also was routed to the h89 cpu board and reset the entire computer. The actual reset occurs on the release
  of the keys.
In mame, the default key for reset is F10. Using the right-shift and F10 now causes the machine (either H19 or H89) to be reset.
A few other general cleanup of comments, formatting, etc. is also done in this PR.

11367: fix SN76496 chip balance in banbam/pettanp [ValleyBell]
The current balance between the two SN76496 chips is off.
A hardware recording can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQIogpkafoU
There is a "fill-in" segment in the music that is very clearly audible in the video at 0:28. However, in MAME it is barely audible
  at all due one of the chips being too quiet.
---
I fixed the balance by measuring the distance of the jump between the "high" and "low" states of the square waves in the intro
  segment present in each stage music.
This segment has a low tone played on sn1 and a higher tone played on sn2. I measured the distance in the OST recording of the song
  and adjusted the balance in MAME accordingly. The balance ended up 1/5 to 1/1.
Note that the overall music volume is decreased a lot (by about -8 db) as result of the rebalancing. The game uses very quiet volume
  levels on "sn2".
This fixes <https://mametesters.org/view.php?id=8662>.

NARC (Erbe) [El Trastero del Spectrum]

-Metadata cleanups: update descriptions, added region and language info tag, moved XML comments to XML notes tag [ArcadeShadow]

-sed1200: Modernize emulation [AJR]
 * Reduce bus to 4 bits (but note that an 8-bit variant exists), and add CS write handler to ensure multiple writes go to the
    correct nibbles. This results in considerable uglification of the mt32 driver code, but is more hardware-accurate.
 * Speculatively eliminate cursor wraparound at first and last positions. This may or may not be accurate, but seems to produce
    neater results.
 * Save state of internal variables.

-pc1000, misterx, ordisava: Emulation overhaul [AJR]
 * Fix bank switching of ROM areas
 * Replace LCDC with type that has the correct accented characters for European versions
 * Add localized key definitions for all three systems; identify all unknown keys and rebind keys to better match
    QWERTY/QWERTZ/AZERTY layouts
 * Eliminate runtime port tag lookups
 * Separate driver from pc2000.cpp

-1943: fix recent regression with bootleg sets [hap]

-buraikenb: comparing the rom data, it's a bootleg after all [hap]

-misc/coinmvga.cpp: fix most of GFX decoding [angelosa]

-osd/modules: Cleaned up most macOS deprecation warnings up to and including 10.13.  [R. Belmont]
 * This raises the hard minimum macOS and SDK versions to 10.13.
 * In practice, the minimum since 0.252 has been macOS 11 Big Sur.
 * 10.13/10.14/10.15 can be built and run with this unsupported patch:
    https://gist.github.com/rb6502/8a1736ee3775f998e8e71faa47ae4b59 The patch works for me, but no guarantees are offered and it may
    break at any time.

-las3000: Add cassette and joystick interfaces (both untested); correct clocks [AJR]

-h8.8: remove erroneous "auto" [hap]

-namcos10: put test switch on F2 [hap]

-heathkit/h89.cpp add support for z37 soft-sector controller (#11276) [Mark Garlanger]

Machines promoted to WORKING
----------------------------
Heathkit H89 [Mark Garlanger]

-emu/devfind.h: Added a lookup() member function to device finders. [Vas Crabb]
 * This simplifies looking up the target device during configuration.  It is useful when configuring child devices in things like
    CPUs with integrated peripherals.
 * emu/device.h: Allow templated subdevice() and siblingdevice() to work with classes that don't derive from device_t (e.g. classes
    that derive from device_interface).
 * util/delegate.h: Added more noexcept.  Won't make much difference as most of the affected member functions are inline anyway.

-coco_fdc: Allow FLEX to work on CoCo machines (#11329) [Michael R. Furman]
 * There are two parts to the change.  First is a correction to the coco_fdc hardware emulation. Second is file format ordering
    adjustments wich make things easier for using FLEX on CoCos.
 * For the hardware change:  Before the change FLEX was unable to boot on CoCo machines.  The behaviour and troubleshooting showed
    that while the FLEX kernel started up it was unable to read anything from Track 0.  Standard FLEX disks have SD(FM) on Track 0,
    and the remainder of the disks (for CoCo FLEX) are normally DD(MFM) or could also be SD(FM).  The bug was in the handling of the
    WDC FDC's INTRQ line.  Reviewing the available documentation and schematics showed that when the FDC asserts INTRQ two things
    happen.  NMI is asserted on the CoCo bus and the HALT signal is cleared.  The MAME code added an incorrect condition on clearing
    HALT: It only happened when Double-Density operation was selected.  This change fixes the logic to work the same way as is shown
    in the schematics, that HALT is cleared any time INTRQ is asserted. SD(FM) disk operations work properly and FLEX boots
    completely and runs correctly after making this change.
 * File Format Ordering Adjustments:  This part of the change makes it easiser to use FLEX in CoCo emulation with a wider variety of
    FLEX-formatted disk images.  The issue here is that due to the way the JVC disk format works it winds up being a catch-all for
    disk images.  Because FLEX has specific formatting requirements and code to handle this and JVC has no support for this special
    formatting, FLEX formats along with DMK and SDF are moved to come before JVC in the formats list.  This allows a wider variery
    of FLEX-formatted disk images to be properly detected.
 * The DMK disk image from the following recent restoration of FHL Color FLEX was used for testing:
 * https://archive.org/details/color-flex-5.0.4-frank-hogg-laboratory

-misc/esripsys.cpp: remove non-existant PORT_PLAYER(3) tags [angelosa]

-bus/a800: modernize cart slot interface (#10528) [Angelo Salese]
 * use address_maps instead of catch-all handlers;
 * implement rd4 and rd5 line views;
 * converted a800_rom_williams_device to the new system, make almost every entry in mega* and prisma* SW to actually boot;
 * bus/a800: implement maxflash_1mb / maxflash_8mb devices.
   - This allows loading arbitrary collection of .xex files built thru Maxflash Cartridge Studio program as flash ROM binaries;
 * bus/a800: implement sic_128kb / sic_256kb / sic_512kb flash ROM devices;
 * bus/a800: implement  ast2k, atrax, Blizzard 32kb, Adawliah, SpartaDOS 128KB, A5200 Super Cart variants;
 * bus/a800: implement Super Charger math unit device;
 * a800_slot.cpp: fix xegs cart default slot for loose cart loading;
 * a800_carts.h: merge a800_turbo64 and a800_turbo128 into single a800_turbo slot option;
 * bus/a800/a800_slot: split a5200 to own interface

    the default result, remember to use std::ref.
 * Updated a few devices to use resolve_safe on device delegates to streamline code.

-taito/taitowlf.cpp: change CMOS type, add Voodoo 1 [angelosa]

-heath/h19.cpp Implement Shift-Reset functionality (#11330) [Mark Garlanger]

-Revert "heath/h19.cpp Implement Shift-Reset functionality (#11330)" [Vas Crabb]
 * This reverts commit 2c0246059f81a9f486f19708cecae2516d205966.
 * This PR obviously wasn't reviewed properly.  It has very obvious issues, in particular:
   - Resetting child devices from device_reset/machine_reset.  Child devices are automatically reset when a device is reset.
   - Changing input state on reset.  This leads to state getting out of sync.  Devices that change their outputs on reset are
      responsible for pushing out the update.

-misc/anes.cpp: Got it to boot and added preliminary video and inputs. (#11324) [Luca Elia, David Haywood]
 * Implemented ROM banking.
