9898: Use correct Toshiba Pasopia7 font rom [palazzol]
Use this new dumped font rom, instead of a hack.  The size and content match the schematics. (4K 2732, not 2K)  For example, the
  second half of the image is the reverse-video of the first half, and the high address line is supposed to be for reverse video.
Finally, it matches the videos of actual Pasopia7's online.
There is a BASIC test program for reverse video, which doesn't work, but I believe that's because the emulation is not hooked up
  right.
All the drivers using the old rom work as well as they did before with this new one.

10849: ep1c12.cpp,cv1k.cpp: More accurate CV1000 Blitter timings. Remove unsafe mode. [buffis]
- Implement cv1000 blitter delay timing for Upload and Draw operations as described in my research here:
  https://buffis.com/docs/CV1000_Blitter_Research_by_buffi.pdf . All timing data is analyzed by me.
- Remove epic12 "unsafe" Blitter mode. The delay introduced here doesn't really have much to do with how things behave on proper
  hardware, and trying to tune it doesn't make a lot of sense.
- Remove some old commented out lines in epic12.cpp which seem to not add much value.
- If EP1C_PRINT_BLITTER_DELAYS is set, print out when a Blitter delay triggers.
- Add documentation for 6 unhandled Blitter command offsets (see blitter_w). Thanks rtw for looking at these.
- Update some docs in cv1k.cpp
This is still not perfect, and further work is needed on CV1000 slowdowns, especially on SH-3 CPU waitstates. I think this is fairly
  accurate in terms of Blitter timings though.

10958: Restructure H19 to pull out code that should be common with the H89. [mgarlanger]
I'm not sure splitting the code up this way is correct, but wanted to put up something that can at least be discussed. Let me layout
  some background info and the goal.
Background:  The H19 and H89 both had the same "Terminal Logic" board which provided all the display/terminal features. The H89 also
  had a CPU board which connected to the terminal board via RS232 serial link (a 8250 on each board). All the functionality that is
  currently in h19.cpp is what the Terminal Logic board provided.
Goal: Restructure the code so that the Terminal Logic functionality is usable in h89.cpp without duplicating the code.
I was hoping since the IO ports are common, it could be shared, but I wasn't able to get h19.cpp to compile with it being in tlb.cpp
  and since it's a static function it can't go in the .h file. If there is a better way to do this, let me know.

11030: set accurate avi framerate instead of rough approximation [vadosnaprimer]
Before, mslugx (59.185606 Hz) would have this AVI framerate
```
framerate:   59.185000000000002
numerator:   59185
denominator: 1000
```
Now, it has
```
framerate:   59.185609563542229
numerator:   1000000000
denominator: 16895999
```
which is directly inherited from the internal refresh rate of the game.
This affects audio/video sync and timings. Here's a comparison of how the same shot at the very start and 200k frames in has audio
  that appears differently:
!изображение
!изображение
After my change, it appears the same in both cases (the sound effect now also appears on the same frame as the shot, but that's just
  a subjective observation without a recording of the real machine):
!изображение
!изображение
Also notice how the same scene happens on entirely different frames. This is because fps value reduction results in duplicate or
  dropped frames in the video, depending if the original value was higher or lower.
PS: AVI duration of the BIOS startup is also different before and after my change (302 vs 261 frames), but I don't know why it
  happens. At least it now matches which internal frame "CREDIT 0" appears on.

• live_info::shift_reg_low() which allows for exact bit matches (> 16)
• update all shift register comparisons to use shift_reg_low(16) (or approrpriate)
• live_info:shift_reg_data() which cleans up several LOGSHIFT() statements

I used this as a reference: https://github.com/hoglet67/6809Decoder/wiki/Undocumented-6809-Behaviours
Sorry for the third attempt at a PR. All of @cuavas 's comments have been addresses. The disassembler treats consecutive page
  opcodes as Vas wishes.

11053: namcos10: Refactor driver + implement MEM(M) and MEM(N) boards [987123879113]
All commits except the namcos10 changes are self-contained and will compile separately in case it'd be preferable to split this
  large PR into smaller PRs.
**namcos10**: 
- Refactored code to split out the different type of memory boards into their own classes because there's some major differences
  between the three
- Implemented machine configurations for all games in order to make it only instantiate the correct number of memory modules (+ it's
  required for every game to have its own decryption device, so just get it out of the way now)
- Added init functions for all possible games which include the required bit scramble order (`kd2001` has no main ROM and `gegemdb`
  has a bad dump for the main ROM so I couldn't do those) which allows all games other than those two to successfully execute the
  BIOS (unrelated to keycus)
- Added input configurations for the games that could be tested
The following games have been promoted to working with this PR:
mrdrilr2 - Mr. Driller 2 (Japan, DR21 Ver.A)
mrdrlr2a - Mr. Driller 2 (World, DR22 Ver.A)
chocovdr - Uchuu Daisakusen: Chocovader Contactee (Japan, CVC1 Ver.A)
startrgn - Star Trigon (Japan, STT1 Ver.A)
gamsharaj - Gamshara (Japan, 10021 Ver.A) [note: `gamshara`, the world version, does NOT work due to suspected different keycus]
konotako - Kono Tako (10021 Ver.A)
nflclsfb (NFL Classic Football (US, NCF3 Ver.A.)) has also been confirmed to work in-game using a patch to skip the EXIO check, but
  proper EXIO emulation is required to make it boot without hacks and be playable because it requires special trackball controls.
Any game not mentioned above does not have a working keycus decrypter and will not work until someone cracks the encryption for
  those games.
Bonus: Small tool I made to bruteforce the scramble order for games. It bruteforces on 8 bits instead of the full 16 bits for
  performance reasons. It works on everything except gjspace which requires the full 16 bits scrambled. This should make it easier
  to add games in the future.
https://gist.github.com/987123879113/2afc61f036b9e230d19a235ab3acbb99
**smartmed**: This was a really old device that combined both the NAND code and the SmartMedia image code in the same file, so I
  split out the NAND code and turned it into an NVRAM device because namcos10 writes its EEPROM data to the first NAND device (it's
  visible at 0x4200 if you open the nand0). I didn't touch the logic of the code because the NAND device itself worked as-is, except
  for the parts where I tried to untangle it from the SmartMedia image code. I tried to modernize the NAND device's
  machine_start/machine_reset a little bit as well as get rid of the `set_nand_type` function in favor of adding device for each
  individual NAND chip type (followed in the style of `intelfsh`). I gave the SmartMedia image code a test using the `juicebox`
  machine and I could successfully load the software after the changes.
**spu**: System 10 uses a different clock (101.4912MHz/2) than a normal PS1 (67.7376MHz/2) so the in-game audio would sound slowed
  down when using the existing spu code, so I changed the spu code to calculate the various rate tables based on the clock of the
  device instead of using a fixed value for calculations.
**intelfsh**: Added support for an Intel StrataFlash specific write to buffer command which is used by System 10 MEM(M) games +
  added Intel 28F640J5 chip.

11065: Fixed memory access handling in the IDT MIPS R4650 core [MooglyGuy]
The IDT MIPS-series manual is rather explicit about the R4650 lacking TLB entirely. Instead, COP0 registers 0 through 3 are occupied
  by Instruction Base/Bound and Data Base/Bound pairs, with the CPU throwing an address error if a user-mode memory access exceeds
  that bound, and adding the Base register to the user-mode access's virtual address if it's in-range.
This fixes an assortment of crashes in at least rapidrvr, rapidrvrp, finfurl, motoxgo, and 500gp due to Namco's own program code
  accessing null or near-null addresses, as all games run in Kernel mode, meaning there is no address translation nor
  bounds-checking.

11071: namcos10: Reevaluate assumption about how later blocks are handled [987123879113]
This does not fix any currently non-working games but it does allow for games that use multiple bootloaders to start the second
  bootloader which was stored in a range I previously thought wouldn't have scrambling.
Information about the invalid block table being at the top of the first block also checks out. mrdrilrga's second bootloader has
  plenty of debug messages, including the one with a function they helpfully named "DumpNandInvalidTable" which prints exactly that
  table.

11072: namco/namcos10.cpp: Added US version of Mr. Driller 2 [987123879113]
Mr. Driller 2 (US, DR23 Ver.A) [TwistedSymphony, Bill, Coolmod, simzy39]
I've used the in-game operator menu to wipe the settings and additionally overwrote the header of the EEPROM section
  (0x40000-0x40020) with 0x55 so that the game will trigger the first boot sequence when you first boot it up. Same thing as done

11073: taito/taito_f3_v.cpp: Ignore first line zoom value (appears to fix MT08593) [y-ack]

checked against pcb recordings for
landmakr(+) pbobble2(+) dariusg(+) recalh(+) elvactr(+) gekiridn(+)
arabianm(=) lightbr(=) bublbob2(=) trstar(=) ringrage(=) kaiserkn(=) bubblem(=)
this... feels questionable without hw testing, and there are certainly other places tilemap offset problems could come from, but
  this is a relatively clean solution, not out of the question for this hardware, and seems to make sense when considering that the
  affected playfields are 2/3 and the way affected games write line zoom for those playfields.

11089: Update PV1000's sound implementation from new research [plgDavid]
A few games (Notably Fighting Bug) set IO $FB bit 1 on and off at various times. This is for sound effect purposes and it XORs
  channels together creating some sonic differences if not emulated. Also PCB traced by lidnariq uncovered that all three sound
  channels are also mixed together at different volumes. Lots of hardware tests were made and available on request.

11091: Encourage use of read/write delegate creator helpers (demo on Game Boy cartridges) [cuavas]
In response to a comment by @galibert about using templates to allow installation of delegates without knowing the exact signature,
  we already have such templates but they’re only used by the address map class.
The only nasty surprise you can get with this is that if you do something like:
```c++
    foo.install_readwrite_handler(
            0x000f, 0x000f,
            emu::rw_delegate(*this, FUNC(some_device::r)),
            emu::rw_delegate(*this, FUNC(some_device::w)));
```
If `r` and `w` omit different parameters (e.g. `r` wants the address space but `w` doesn’t), then you get a compile error.
I *could* address that, and it would probably reduce the number of lines in emumem.h, but it would be a bit more churn.
And with the third commit, the nasty surprise no longer happens.  It cuts sixteen virtual member functions from address spaces and
  memory views, but makes installing a pair of read/write handlers marginally less efficient.

11092: namco/namcos10: New dumps (medalnt2, taiko4, taiko5) and redumps (ballpom, g13jnc, gjspace, puzzball, taiko6) [987123879113]
ballpom was previously known as unks10md2 but was able to be named with the redump. ballpom boots but needs an MGEXIO board to
  function so you will only see an error screen. I noted in the driver you can make a cheat to patch memory addr 0x8007af02 to be 0
  which will skip the error for testing.
The old mrdrilrg main entry was a bad dump. Doing a deeper inspection of the game data itself (taking the invalid block table into
  account) revealed that the game data was the same as mrdrilrga which is a good dump, so I removed mrdrilrga and replaced mrdrilrg
  with the ROM entries that were in mrdrilrga.
I added a blurb to the header aimed at dumpers and anyone trying to verify dumps because there was a lot of confusion recently about
  what was and wasn't a bad dump. I've also unmarked ptblank3 and gunbalina as being BAD_DUMPS which do not appear to be bad dumps
  on inspection (previous claims of them being bad dumps because of protection were due to a misunderstanding of how the NANDs
  worked). knpuzzle, gamshara (NOT gamsharaj), gegemdb, and sekaikha were marked as BAD_DUMPS after inspection.
I reordered the init_x, ns10_x, and the ROM_START sections functions so they're alphabetical because it was becoming a bit hard to
  find games. The GAME entries section was also sorted (year -> game set name with parent at top).

11097: nscsi/cd: Implement basic CDDA support [987123879113]
I initially made this NSCSI CDDA implementation to go with another PR but ran into some harder to resolve issues, but this code is
  being requested for some other machines so I am submitting it on its own. I've left TODOs for things I couldn't test on my targets
  and couldn't find something that made use of the feature. Implemented enough that CDDA audio worked on Konami GV games during
  testing. I didn't want to break the old code and don't know of a better default value so I set `mode_data_size` to default to the
  same as what `sizeof(mode_data)` returned.
Also found an issue with the `set_output_gain` calls in t10mmc.cpp when cross referencing between the documentation and the old
  CD-ROM code so I threw in a fix for that as well.

11099: sanyo/mbc200.cpp: Fix floppy drive selection (was stuck on A:) [zx70]
This should recreate the exact behavior of the original floppy drive selector, driving a 74145 with bits 4..6 of port B of the 8255A
  PPI.
The original machines had only 1 or 2 floppy disk drives, but it was possible, as an option, to add 2 external drives,  a BIOS
  alteration source code for the 8" format was provided, but the boot disk loaded the same format/skew table for all the 4 devices.

11100: psikyo/psikyo.cpp: Use accurate measurements for Tengai video timings [buffis]
Adds correct timings for Tengai to psikyo.cpp.
Measured using a Saleae Logic Pro 16 logic analyzer, sampling at 500Mhz.
Pictures, logic traces are available at:
http://img.buffis.com/psikyo/tengai/
(Also random note, I think the HSync timing specied for Strikers 1945 in the docs is likely incorrect, but I haven't had time to
  check on my Strikers 1945 board yet)

11101: psikyo.cpp : Fixes an off-by-one error in m_screen->set_raw [buffis]
Fixes a off-by-one error where number of visible lines were 223 instead of 224.
There are indeed 39 HSync PULSES between the visible color data... but the first one of those are signaling the end of the previous
  visible frame, and the last one of them is signaling the start of first visible row of the next frame, which means that there's 38
  "non-visible" lines during blanking.
This means:
262 total lines. 224 visible. 38 blanking.

11102: psikyo/psikyo.cpp: Fixed docs for sync timings of Tengai and Strikers 1945 [buffis]
The code for Tengai was updated to be correct, but not the docs. This fixes the docs too.
I was looking at sync-pulses surrounding front/back-porch, and sync pulses during vblank previously. This is an incorrect way of
  looking at things.
See: http://img.buffis.com/psikyo/tengai/vblank.png which has a very easy to grasp visual representation of the VBlank lines.

GEW7 and MultiPCM now share a common base class that handles sample decoding, mixing, envelope generation, etc. In the process I
  fixed a handful of issues that affected both devices:
- fixed potential out of bounds array reads due to unsigned wraparound when calculating envelope steps, which could lead to garbage
  output for certain octave/rate combinations (`gew_pcm_device::get_rate`, `gew_pcm_device::envelope_generator_calc`)
- fixed envelopes getting stuck at max when D1R = DL = 0 and D2R > 0 (`gew_pcm_device::envelope_generator_update` for DECAY1)
- fixed off-by-one octave value when calculating envelope rates, per OPL4 manual (`gew_pcm_device::envelope_generator_calc`)
- fixed potential out-of-tune sample loops due to not accounting for the current sample position correctly
  (`gew_pcm_device::sound_stream_update` when offset >= end)
- fixed sample lengths being off by one for MultiPCM (`multipcm_device::init_sample`)
- added calls to `sound_stream::update` for MultiPCM where appropriate (register reads/writes)
- added missing members to save states
The MU5 now sounds much better than before, though the demo still has some noticeable problems with at least one instrument having a
  much slower attack than it's supposed to, and probably other issues. I added the imperfect sound flag to `gew_pcm_device` as a
  result.

11114: namcos10: More dumps/redumps, new decryption devices, and more I/O emulation [987123879113]
This PR contains changes from various sources (Peter Wilhelmsen and Samuel Neves for their new decryption device code, Guru updating
  his readme with new games and PCB documentation, everything else me).
tmp95c061: Filled out A/D code to allow for A/D values to be returned properly. The implementation method was copied for consistency
  from tmp95c063. Also fixed ADMOD and INTE0AD registers enough to get the EXIO program to run.
ns10crypt: Samuel Neves and Peter Wilhelmsen provided decryption devices for GAHAHA Ippatsudou (gahaha), Golgo 13: Juusei no
  Chinkonka (g13jnc), Sekai Kaseki Hakken (sekaikh), and Pacman BALL (pacmball). Please make sure Samuel Neves and Peter Wilhelmsen
  get proper credit for these as without their work these games would be otherwise be completely unbootable.
namcos10 specific:
- Marked all games as MACHINE_IMPERFECT_SOUND in anticipation of complaints. There are various times where audio is not working as
  expected (stopping too soon, some distortion/glitching, etc). g13jnc also lacks MP3 support for now so BGMs won't play at all.
- Implemented the basics for EXIO and MGEXIO and split off the expansion I/O boards into their own file because the main driver was
  getting hard to follow since it has all of the classes for each ROM board type.
- Implemented the basics of the MEM(P3) MEM/IO board
- Added controls for more games that can boot now
- pacmball marked as BAD_DUMP (confirmed the ROMs are bad dumps after being able to boot it)
- Guru updated the readme in the header
Promotions:
- Golgo 13: Juusei no Chinkonka (Japan, GLT1 VER.A) promoted to working. BGM audio does not work but the game appears to be
  otherwise playable after the gun is calibrated in the operator menu.
- Kotoba no Puzzle Mojipittan (Japan, KPM1 Ver.A) (knpuzzle) promoted to working.
- GAHAHA Ippatsudou (World, GID2 Ver.A) (gahaha) promoted to working now that the required I/O board and controls are implemented.
  GAHAHA Ippatsudou 2 (Japan, GIS1 Ver.A) too.

11119: sega/sg1000.cpp: fixed tape loading [fabiodl]
The high part of the port is always connected to the cassette interface, and should not be masked by the joystick. See

11120: psikyo.cpp: Remove MACHINE_IMPERFECT_TIMING and fix some docs [buffis]
- Remove MACHINE_IMPERFECT_TIMING from psikyo.cpp roms
- Minor documentation fixes (IRQ info, typo for LH5168)
Main motivation for the incorrect timing seems to be that these have four frames of input lag. This is actually consistent with PCBs
  though, unlike what the comment states.
When doing measurements with a 240fps iphone camera and "Is it snappy" on Tengai, the current behavior is:
- Input is triggered during a frame (and likely sampled during vblank?)
- Three frames of inaction follows
- The fourth frame afterwards, the sprite moves.
With sprites at top of screen, this gives delays of 54.2ms -> 62.5ms for me from input press, to sprite changing.
This is consistent with mame behavior:
- Press pause
- Hold an input and step-pause until movement
- Movement will trigger on fourth frame

11123: sanyo/mbc200.cpp: Mix PPI sound outputs for system speaker [zx70]
The MBC-200 speaker can be driven by 2 PPI chips, connected to one of the two Z80 CPUs, through 1Kohm resistors. The speaker is
  driven by a simple bipolar transistor commutation, and the sound is always generated by simple bit-banging loops on one of the two
  CPUs. The audio level is fixed, no matter whether both the CPUs are sending a high level input together. The keyboard click is..
  just a short ON/OFF commutation, no oscillation at all !

11125: namcos10.cpp : reset gahaha,gahaha2,g13jnr to defaults [DavidHaywood]

11131: namcos10: New dumps/redumps, support CD drive and Taiko I/O [987123879113]
- Added new dump of Seishun-Quiz Colorful High School (CHS1 Ver.A) [Guru]
- Added redump of Point Blank 3 from Guru. This was initialized on the machine before redumping. The redump confirmed that the old
  dump was a good dump so the only thing that changed in this was the EEPROM section data (0x4200-0x8400).
- Tsukkomi Yousei Gips Nice Tsukkomi doesn't appear to have a CD after all after more testing by Guru
- Added some notes about the MEM(P3) board
- Taiko no Tatsujin 2, 4, and 6 decrypter code by Samuel Neves, Peter Wilhelmsen
- Puzz Ball decrypter added by Samuel Neves, Peter Wilhelmsen
- Tsukkomi Yousei Gips Nice Tsukkomi decrypter added by Samuel Neves, Peter Wilhelmsen
- nicetsuk does something weird with pads shouldn't even be connected which is causing issues due to a bug I believe to be in the
  rcnt device (doesn't seem to implement all synchronization modes), so I added a hack to just disabled the pad callbacks functions.
  The inputs work normally in-game without it so I am unsure what it's actually used for but I suspect left over from debugging.
For taiko specifically:
- Implemented CD-ROM support for Taiko and was able to document some more interrupt and DMA registers with it
- Added a new command to t10mmc that Taiko relies on to read data. The actual command itself is much more complex (it's apparently
  meant to be a "reads everything" type of command that can do everything from subchannel data to headers to plain data and more)
  but I only implemented the parts I could test.
Lastly, I added a way to force the PSX SPU to use `STREAM_SYNCHRONOUS` when requested. I think probably any game using PSX hardware
  that relies on strict SPU IRQ timings for DMAs will probably benefit from `STREAM_SYNCHRONOUS` but I also understand it's not an
  ideal solution so I made it a configurable flag you must set to use. For streaming BGMs in Taiko no Tatsujin, the game is only
  requesting 256 bytes total to be DMA'd from PSX memory into the SPU at a time and only seems to send more when the IRQ is
  triggered. Sound effects are DMA'd in at 1024 bytes at a time so don't seem to have any issues. I believe it's running into an
  issue when playing BGMs where there's not enough data to fill the stream buffer at the rate requested which causes lots of audio
  glitches and the audio to not play at the correct speed. I think because `STREAM_SYNCHRONOUS` makes the sound stream only update 1
  sample at a time, IRQs can be triggered and handled by the game sooner than if the IRQ is triggered sometime during a larger
  stream update.

11132: default several namcos10.cpp sets [DavidHaywood]

11134: namco/namcos10: Add another decrypter + fix nicetsuk button mapping [987123879113]
It was discovered that the IVs change per game so I've added a new `iv_calculation` function to allow for per-game customizable IVs
  which will probably be used more for the remaining decrypters. Also fixed nicetsuk's button mapping to be more sane.

11136: namco/namcos10: Added decrypter for Panicuru Panekuru + initialized settings for panikuru and squizchs [987123879113]
namco/namcos10: Add decrypter for Panicuru Panekuru [Samuel Neves, Peter Wilhelmsen]
Also fixed an issue with squizchs's IV thanks to Samuel Neves and Peter Wilhelmsen. The game would use the decrypter to load some
  data from the NAND in-game so this was discovered late.
Pulled in some changes from Haze as well, thank you.

-API change for device_image_interface [AJR]
 * Remove the seterror method for recording error messages and conditions. Condition codes have been made return values for
    call_load, call_create and various related callbacks. Error messages (which many devices weren't generating) are now displayed
    through osd_printf_error.
 * Eliminate the image_init_result and image_verify_result pass/fail enumeration types. Update many functions that were returning
    these enumerations or simply bools to return std::error_condition instead. In some cases, this type is now passed down from
    internal parsing/loading functions which were already returning it. In various other cases, the former default UNSPECIFIED has
    been used as a catchall for I/O errors; anticipated future refactorings should make these error returns more specific.
 * Expand the image_error categories to include INVALIDLENGTH, NOSOFTWARE and BADSOFTWARE. The first is largely self-explanatory.
    The second is generated by the core to indicate failure to find software items in lists. The third is provided for devices to
    indicate semantic errors in software list entries.
 * Change the return type of floppy_image_device::identify to a pair so the potential error condition can be passed along to the UI
    without storing it in a member variable.
 * Move device_image_interface::message down into snapshot_image_device and change its implementation to use string_format instead
    of printf.
 * Correct a typo in the shortname of the generic snapshot device.

 * Restores ability to give specific/detailed messages removed in 6f7e4141ea14acaaf9cb973c66788fabb3457023 while pandering to
    obsession with single return value.
 * Moved responsibility for displaying the error message in the UI to the caller rather than device_image_interface, and made
    device_image_interface always log the error along with the full path and error condition content.

New NOT_WORKING software list additions
---------------------------------------
X & Y (Arab) [file-hunter]

-apple2video: Fixed another regression where composite double-hi-res was usually monochrome. [R. Belmont]

-Allow loading PNG/JPEG/MS DIB bitmaps from Lua, and cleanup. [Vas Crabb]
 * Use VirtualAlloc rather than VirtualProtect on Windows to change page protection, as the latter can cause severe performance
    issues with some antivirus software.
 * Added noexcept to lots of hash- and bitmap-related things, and added a little more error checking.  Yes, I realise it will abort
    if an allocation fails while printing a log message, but if you get to that point, you're probably screwed already.

-free220: Improve video [Dirk Best]

-psikyo/psikyo.cpp: Use accurate measurements for Tengai video timings. (#11100) [buffi]
 * Measured using a Saleae Logic Pro 16 logic analyzer, sampling at 500Mhz.
 * I think the HSync timing specied for Strikers 1945 in the docs is likely incorrect, but I haven't had time to check on my
    Strikers 1945 board yet.

-sanyo/mbc200.cpp: Fixed floppy drive selection (was stuck on A:). (#11099) [Stefano]

-msx/msx.cpp, bus/msx: Propagate clock to slots, and route audio input from cartridges. (#11074) [wilbertpol]

-Miscellaneous improvements: [Vas Crabb]
 * infoxml.cpp: Thread device processing.  Gives about a 10% speed improvement overall, and avoids the need to mess with the locale
    of the ultimate output stream.
 * debugger/win/consolewininfo.cpp: Show image mount/create error messages on the console.
 * emu/devdelegate.h, util/delegate.h: Added deduction guides for common delegate creation patterns (only used in sega/segas16a.cpp
    so far).
 * More noexcept on things that have no business throwing exceptions.

-skeleton/freedom220.cpp: Fix bad merge. [Vas Crabb]
