9307: Fix various C64 tapes [ZoeB]
This patch largely reverts my previous attempt at "improving" things, with my apologies!
1. I've undone "optimising" some of the Ultimate Tape Archive's dumps, as it turns out they were more fastidious than the tools I
  was using, not less
2. Now the originals are back in place, I've removed the redundant subsequent "alt" additions of the originals
3. In cases where the Ultimate Tape Archive has dumped the same tapes as me, I've replaced mine with theirs (they're more fastidious
  than me too, and I gave them my own physical tapes, so you're not missing anything)
4. I also added Micro Rhythm +, while I was there
These are all sourced from the Ultimate Tape Archive V3.0, the current latest version of the archive.
Thanks!

10476: news_r3k.cpp: Add support for the NWS-3410 [briceonk]
This will probably need some work before merging, but opening it up for review early since it is touching pre-existing code. This
  refactors the news_r3k driver so that the LCD panel is only present on the laptop models (for now, just the 3260 but hopefully
  more like the 3150 bigNEWS will show up some day :)) and adds the ROM metadata for the 3410. It boots to the monitor ROM just
  fine, but NetBSD hangs during SCSI init :(
One thing I need to check with the owner of the machine (and will update on this PR once I hear back) is if the IDROM dump is
  available. I tested this with the 3260 IDROM patched to look like a 3410.

10710: Add Vector 4 [ejona86]
This is the follow-up to #10697. See `vector4.cpp` for main TODO. ~Floppy support is cheating but quite functional in practice.~
  (implemented) ~I sort of expect to add MFM HDD support before swapping to the real floppy infrastructure.~ (I failed to notice how
  IBM-centric the formatting is. I realized it would need most of the same stuff as floppy.)
~I am working to dump the ROMs from a Vector 4 that CP/M-86 and MS-DOS were used on; I'm hoping it is a newer ROM and that fixes the
  booting issue for those OSes.~ (Yep, old roms didn't support it. Booting gets further, but still not working.)

10778: nes.xml: New working software list addition [FoxhackDN]
Battletoads (Brazil, Conector pirate) [chirinea]

10832: Added new roms and comments to M20 hash file [eberhab]
Added more game roms to the M20 hash file. This should now be a more or less complete list of all the games that are available for
  the M20.
Also added a comment about a common issue with some of the already existing bootable system roms and how to fix it.

10862: Amstrad PDA600 [sronco]
To make code review easier I've separated changes to individual components into separate commits, I've also done a quick regression
  test on all the drivers that uses a Z180 with -str 60 and everything seems fine.

10878: machine/6522via.cpp: Make input ports read transparently when corresponding interrupt flag is clear [mzattera]
**** ***THIS IS UNTESTED*** ******
*I have created this pull request to address the below and document a possible fix.*
----------------------
From http://archive.6502.org/datasheets/mos_6522_preliminary_nov_1977.pdf and
  http://archive.6502.org/datasheets/synertek_sy6522_via_1978_jan.pdf
MCS6522/SYS6522 OPERATION
-------------------------
[...]
C. PORT A REGISTERS, PORT B REGISTERS
[...] With input latching enabled, IRA will reflect the contents of the Port A prior to setting the CA1 Interrupt Flag (IFRl) by an
  active transition on CA1 [...] With input latching enabled on Port B, setting CB1 interrupt flag will cause IRB to latch this
  combination of input data and ORB data **until the interrupt flag is cleared** [...]
Auxiliary Control Register
--------------------------
[...]
.1. PA Latch Enable
The MCS6522/SYS6522 provides input latching on both the PA and PB ports. In this mode, the data present on the peripheral A input
  pins will be latched within the chip **when the CA1 interrupt flag is set**. Reading the PA port will result in these latches
  being transferred into the processor. **As long as the CA1 interrupt flag is set**, the data on the peripheral pins can change
  without affecting the data in the latches. This input latching can be used with any of the CA2 input or output modes [...]
.2. PB Latch Enable
Input latching on the PB port is controlled in the same manner as that described for the PA port[...]
----------------------
From: http://archive.6502.org/datasheets/rockwell_r6522_via.pdf
FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
----------------------
PORT A AND PORT B OPERATION
[...] With input latching enabled, IRA will reflect the levels on the PA pins at the time the latching occurred (via CA1). The IRB
  register operates similar to the IRA register [...]
From: http://archive.6502.org/datasheets/synertek_sy6522.pdf
2.0 Port A and Port B
[...] **Not until CA1 or CB1 has transitioned (as programmed in the PCR) will any data be latched**. Now a read of the input
  register will reflect the data that was on the port line at the time of the latching transition. **After this read the input
  registers will again appear transparent until the next CA1 or CB1 transition.** See Figure 2 [...]
----------------------
This  means, accordingly to the data sheets (as I understand it):
1a) Even if input latching is set, unless a active transition happens on CA1/CA2, reading a port will return the  same result as if
  latching is disabled (that is, it will read input pins for port A and a combination of input pins/ORA for port b). See Figure 2
  Read A in http://archive.6502.org/datasheets/synertek_sy6522.pdf.
2a) An active transition on CA1/CB1 while in latching mode will latch the input. This, at the same time, sets  corresponding flags
  in IFR. Therefore "active transition on CA1/CB1" and "setting IFR flags for CA1/CB1" are synonyms.
3a) As long as latching is enabled **AND corresponding bits in IFR are set**, reading a port will return the latched value. Note
  that, depending on how PCR is set, reading/writing ports also clears corresponding bit in IFR, disabling latching (mode 000 and
  010 for CA2/CB2 control) which will cause next read to read actual inputs and not latched values.
Current MAME behavior (again, as I understand it) is:
1b) If input latching is set, always read the latched value. Note this happens even if no positive transition on CA1/CB1 has
  happened yet, so I think the latch might not be properly initialized.
2b) Works same as 2a)
3a) As long as latching is enabled, reading a port will return the latched value. Clearing IFR flags for CA1/CB1 has no effect on
  latching. This means if a read/write is performed in mode 000 and 010, which clears IFR bits, next read will still return the
  latched value. This contrasts with Figure 2 Read C, D in http://archive.6502.org/datasheets/synertek_sy6522.pdf.

10886: PCMCIA: Add support for SRAM cards [startaq]
- Add callbacks for card detect, battery voltage and write protect to the PCCard interface
- Add helpers to read/write data swapped (similar to the existing support in the ATA device)
- Add support for 2 MB and 4 MB SRAM PCMCIA models from Centennial. Those have a builtin eeprom storage for CIS information
- Rewrite the Amiga Gayle emulation, adding support for PCMCIA
- Fix an issue with Amiga interrupts arriving at the wrong time
- Update the linear flash card emulation to use the new card detection support
Screenshots showing support in the Amiga 600 driver:

!0004

10890: msx/cart/slotexpander.cpp: Add slot expander [wilbertpol]

10892: Fix sprintf compiler warnings (MacOS) [enewton]
When compiling on Mac, I'm getting hundreds of deprecation warnings along the lines of:
```
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/stdio.h:188:1: note:
  'sprintf' has been explicitly marked deprecated here
__deprecated_msg("This function is provided for compatibility reasons only.  Due to security concerns inherent in the design of
  sprintf(3), it is highly recommended that you use snprintf(3) instead.")
```
I don't know if we get them on other operating systems.
Do we want/need to fix these by using snprintf?
I've done a few as an example:
Most are a straight: snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), ...
Some are a bit more fancy and use std::string instead of a char array.
What do you think? Shall I upgrade more of theses?

10899: Android  build and SDL2 removal [mmicko]
- SDL2 sources are removed, saving more than 80MB
- It is now possible to build Android builds with latest NDK
- Instructions are added in docs (same as we have for other platforms)
- Still using API24 (Android 7.0) as minimal requirement
- Fixed issue with logging on Android
- Made BGFX actually work while using Android build

10901: misc/babysuprem.cpp: Now working machine [Paul-Arnold]
Update driver to make Baby Suprem a playable game.
There is a basic layout file which allows the game to be played but a proper layout with artwork is really needed in the future.
Not sure I've used the correct flags for this where the game is declared ?

10912: Update Japanese translation [k2-git]
Update Japanese translation (Analog Input etc.)

10914: hng64_sprite.ipp - render sprites to buffer, apply blending in mix stage, fixes sprite->sprite priorities etc. [DavidHaywood]
- render sprites to buffer, apply blending in mix stage, fixes sprite->sprite priorities etc.
- added mesh/checkerboard fake transparency sprites, they were previously being treated as 'skip this sprite'
- improved precision of sprite scaling, fixing gaps and smoothness of scale in many places
- improved floor layer rendering for buriki and fatfurwa

10917: Fix building with gcc-13 [belegdol]

10919: Simplify n64 rdp disassembler [enewton]
This is a continuation from my previous PR, of removing sprintf's from the code base.
It removes all snprintf's from the n64 disassembler and reduces some code duplication.
I tested it with a few ROMs but can't get all the changed OP codes to fire, but reasonably confident about it.
It doesn't change any behaviour except some column alignment, which I think was wrong previously. It now lines up more consistently.

10920: taito/taito_f3_v.cpp: line clip fixes, landmakr/quizhuhu palette fix [y-ack]
 - respect all 4 clip planes (needed by landmakrj, quizhuhu)
 - remove some incorrect assumptions about clip plane 3 enable bit being a clip disable
 - found a 'invert clip inverse mode' flag. most games set it, caused problems with unset pbobble4, commandw
 - don't truncate landmakr/quizhuhu palette offsets: caused green fades in quizhuhu, incorrect win message colors in landmakrj.
  apparently the truncation fixed symptoms in a number of games, deserves more research.
fixes mt00950: landmakr: Winning message is missing.
fixes mt01014: quizhuhu: The question text is not displayed.
fixes mt02819: pbobble4 and clones: Victory screen not shown at end of match
fixes commandw map display
fixes quizhuhu pre-taito logo intro not visible
fixes landmakr ending slide display

10921: Updated Greek UI translation [BraiNKilleRGR]

10923: msx2_cart.xml: Add serials, gtins and updated notes. [wilbertpol]

10924: Do not error out on -video auto -videodriver wayland [belegdol]
As of 2810c9d BGFX is no longer default on SDL, OpenGL is

10925: misc/rawthrillspc.cpp: Add some notes about Doodle Jump hardware [clawgrip]

10926: bus/ISA: Added HP82321A BASIC Language coprocessor [svenschnelle]
This adds support for the HP82321A BLP cards sold by HP about 35 years ago. Note that this needs a quirk in the new68k to extend a
  68k bus cycle until the x86 host served the request. I'm happy for smarter ways to achive this.

10929: vsmile_cart.xml: Add a new UK game cart dump and use hex for ROM sizes [clawgrip]

10933: Remove sprintf from dsp56156 [enewton]
Replacing use of sprintf with util::string_format
Improve disassemble function signature.
I've run a quick back to back test using Polygonet Commanders, but can't guarantee I've hit every changed op code.

10934: mame.lst: Add 'sauroc' and add year to 'spirulo' [clawgrip]

10935: hng64_sprite.ipp : improved sprite mosaic effect [DavidHaywood]
- sprite mosaic now works for y direction too
- improved transition control register use for fade effects on buriki one jumbotron
- various notes

10938: news_r3k.cpp: Flag NWS-3410 graphics as unimplemented [briceonk]

10939: sony/news_r4k.cpp: Fix NWS-5000X graphics flag [briceonk]

10941: hng64_3d.ipp : use 16-bit framebuffer rather than 32-bit for the 3D, so it can be passed as index values into the mixer
  [DavidHaywood]
- use 16-bit framebuffer rather than 32-bit for the 3D, so it can be passed as index values into the mixer
note, looks a bit worse for now in terms of lighting, but I think this is going to be closer to how the hardware works, just our
  lighting calculations are wrong anyway.

10942: Allow additional input mapping for pdrift Gear Shift [sairuk]
Remove `PORT_CODE(KEYCODE_SPACE)` from the `pdrift` Gear Shift to permit controller and mouse inputs to be mapped at machine start
  when available, currently only the `SPACE` key is mapped no matter what is connected, this behaviour appears to be an oversight
  from eb2b889 where cleanup of similar inputs occurred.

10943: taito/taito_f3_v.cpp: line ram palette add effect [y-ack]

not sure what the previous "can affect opacity" comment is trying to imply, assuming just that palette add happens before blending.
it might be nice for playfields to opt out of effects like this in all-zero cases but that's begging a real rewrite.

10944: vectorgraphic/vector4.cpp: Add keyboard MCU [ejona86]

10945: vectorgraphic/vector4.cpp: Add Centronics printer support [ejona86]

10947: hng64.cpp - further video improvements [DavidHaywood]
- identified 'blend' flag for 3D objects, and did a minimal implementation (used in many places, eg. shadows in fatfurwa, buriki,
  final boss in sams64_2)
- emulated 'split' tilemap effect (needed by buriki one character introductions)
- don't draw sprites with '0' zoom values, rather than using an unscaled sprite (needed by sams64 text at start of round)
- make 'sprite erase' code less aggressive (prevent it from wiping out palette values) (needed by sams64 2nd intro)
- support 'texture scrolling' (used by windows on cars in xrally/roadedge, waterfalls in xrally)

10948: Some simple sprintf warning fixes [enewton]
This is most of the simple to fix ones.

Replaced the msx_1drive and msx_2drives layouts with a single msx layout.
Since the 'code' key can have different labels depending on the intended region for the machines, the region has been added to the
  drivers.

10951: seibu/bloodbro_ms.cpp: Dumped and added missing ROMs [Museo del Recreativo] [clawgrip]

10952: skeleton bus device for SNES copiers of the Pro Fighter family [Osso13]

- fixed PLD dumps to make them convertable via jedutil [Vas Crabb]
- created skeleton bus device for the Pro Fighter family of SNES copiers

10953: Stop endless beep on Heathkit H19 [mgarlanger]
Fix an apparent copy-n-paste issue that was introduced with restructure of device timer from
  https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/9788

10954: Make company name consistent across all Heathkit machines [mgarlanger]
Update company name in h19.cpp and h89.cpp to match the name in h8.cpp and et3400.cpp. "Heath Company" is the name the company used

10965: neogeo/neogeo.cpp: Don't treat puzzldpr as a clone, added additional irrmaze BIOS [DavidHaywood]
- puzzldpr was a new version of the game, a year later, with separate ID number, it shouldn't be considered a clone.
- added a BIOS found on a restored Japanese Irritating Maze cabinet, sadly it appears to be a hack done by the arcade distributor
  who restored it (probably the original mainboard was missing when the restoration was done?) [Simon Taylor]

10967: apple3: Add support for control-reset. [ksherlock]
Apple /// Owner's guide page 12:
"If the power is already on, the procedure for booting is to hold down the CONTROL key while you press and release the RESET button
  behind the keyboard."
Additionally, control-open apple-reset will drop into the (very simple) monitor.

Desert Wars (bootleg of Battle Zone) [Javier Blanco Ojeda, ClawGrip]
Also reformatted single-line comments

10969: sinclair/pentevo.cpp: Add ERS v0.59.12/NEO-DOS v0.57 BIOS options [holub]

10970: atari/irobot_m.cpp: Initialise mathbox stack after loading decoding opcode PROMs [jflatt]
Originally, irobot_state::init_irobot() starts first and sets up m_irmb_stack with addresses from m_mbops.  Then it called
  irobot_state::load_oproms() where m_mbops gets redefined on line 321.  This triggers an assertion in std::unique_ptr.h, something
  like "get() != pointer()".  Moving the load_oproms() call earlier does not cause the assertion to happen.

10971: hng64.cpp - current progress, including using raster effect to enable fatfurwa floor [DavidHaywood]
- added support for raster interrupt, needed to enable fatfurwa floor without ignoring the 'enable' bit with a hack
- various experiments with priority, still needs a proper per pixel mixer, but this gives a ballpark idea of any special cases that
  will need further attention
- various experiments with the remaining colour mixer effects, still imperfect, but again this helps highlight areas in need of more
  attention

10972: msx.cpp: Add Yamaha UCN-01 cartridge->module slot converter. [wilbertpol]

10973: es5503.cpp: preserve fractional phase, allows high-freq sample play [Peter Ferrie] [peterferrie]

10976: tsconf.cpp: revisit INT priorities [holub]

10979: More sprintf warning fixes [enewton]
Trying to keep these smaller to help review.
Some more sprintf removal to fix compiler warnings.
The slightly controversial part of this one is promoting the clock_mode enum to an enum class.
Not sure about the name ClockMode; the codebase has a mix of case styles, and generally seem to be all lower case?

10980: Upgrade acorn sys1 to use ioport_array [enewton]
Uploading one as a check I'm doing this correctly before doing more.
I didn't have to change much because the first 8 refs in INPUT_PORTS_START are the keyboard already.
Questions:
1) Does the zero in `m_keyboard(*this, "X%u", 0U)` mean start from the first def in INPUT_PORTS_START, or something else? Is it
  finding by name using the "X%u"?
2) Nothing appears to reference the port refs `reset` `switch` & `config`. Are these some standard names, or just not connected up?
3) I've noticed that (even before I changed anything) keys such as Esc and Tab don't work like other emulations. Is that expected?

10983: Fixed GH issue #10977, broken bloom in HLSL mode. [MooglyGuy]
-bloom.fx: Return an alpha of 1 rather than texel alpha. Fixes #10977 [Ryan Holtz]

10984: msx.cpp: Move yamaha module and minicart slots into their own folders. [wilbertpol]

10987: rgbgen: Safely compute out of range shifts [invertego]
The SSE and VMX implementations of rgbaint_t have consistent and well defined behavior for out of range shifts: the shift amount is
  treated as unsigned and shifts equal to or greater than the element width either zero the result (shl, shr) or replicate the sign
  into every bit (sra).
Shifts of this amount are undefined behavior in C++ and so extra checks have been added to reproduce the same behavior in the
  generic implementation. The validity checker has also been updated to add cases for out of range shifts.
Some explicit sign extensions have been removed from sra() as the validity checker already requires that signed right shifts must be
  arithmetic.
This bug was encountered when building the N64 RDP for ARM64 as it caused very obvious rendering artifacts.

10989: KC 85 rework sound [utz82]
This is an overhaul of the sound emulation for the VEB Mikroelektronik KC 85/2..4 (ddr/kc).
The KC 85 series has 3 distinct sound outputs, which are currently not emulated as such:
1. Two 1-bit channels K0 and K1, driven by flip-flops via CTC channels 0 and 1, connected to the left and right channels on the Tape
  output. This feature is commonly used in music editors from the era. K0 and K1 are always in an undefined state (so they can be
  toggled but not set to a specific state), except on KC 85/4, where they can be reset to a known state via PIO B.
2. A binary weighted DAC that outputs on the RGB/FBAS port, with volume control via PIO B. Offers 5 bits of volume control on KC
  85/2 and 85/3, and 4 bits of volume control on the KC 85/4. The signal sum of K0 and K1 is routed through the DAC. This feature
  was not used much back in the day as RGB monitors were largely unavailable, but is used by some modern demos (eg. Ancient
  Civilizations).
3. An internal speaker, driven by K0. KC 85/2 does not have this feature. On KC 85/4, K0 is only passed through if the volume level
  on the DAC is at least 1.
In order to handle the differences between the various KC models, I split up the combined KC 85/2+85/3 driver, so each of the KC
  models now has its own, separate driver (except KC 85/5 which is just a mod of KC 85/4 with extra RAM). I re-used the existing
  `speaker_sound_device` for emulating the internal speaker, and used additional `speaker_sound_device`s for the DAC and Tape
  outputs. I also fixed a bug in the KC 85/4 driver, where the CTC was not connected to the system clock.
As far as I can tell, this completes emulation of these machines for the most part, so you might consider promoting them to
  'working' status. The only remaining major issue seems to be that quickload on KC 85/2 and 85/3 happens prematurely (ie. before
  the system has finished booting). I'm unsure how to fix this, however.

10990: hng64.cpp - small video improvements [DavidHaywood]
- fixed name entry screen on roadedge
- don't buffer sprites (render them in the same update call as we use them)
- fix extra texture scroll (was double what it should have been), fixes some tv screens/billboards in roadedge
- some additional code safety on texture fetches
- minor refactoring to better facilitate further experiments

10991: konami/hyperspt.cpp: Add note about Tecfri set [clawgrip]

10992: Oric1 Software List [enewton]
I'm trying to put together a software list for the Oric1.
I did ask on the forum some questions but not sure how much traffic that gets:
  https://forum.mamedev.org/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=894&sid=665161912258e79bd1d640c551908ed5
I've pressed ahead, assuming this doesn't already exist and is useful.
My main problem: I can't get Mame to recognise the file. Do I need to add a reference to it somewhere else in the source, or name it
  subtly different, or something wrong in the header of the file? E.g. oric vs oric1
Can anyone help please?

10993: ddr/kc: fix DAC output on KC 85/2 [utz82]
Remove an erroneous shift on the output data on KC 85/2. Since the DAC works the same way on 85/2 and 85/3, there is no need to
  maintain a separate function for handling PIO B writes on 85/3. Thanks to @ValleyBell for catching this.
I also tested using a `dac_byte_device` instead of a `speaker_sound_device`, which would save some more code. Unfortunately this
  introduces some additional sound artifacts which don't happen with the latter (and neither on actual hardware), so I have
  abandoned this idea for now.

11019: Lua engine: run everything in coroutines [cuavas]
This has two visible effects:
* `emu.wait(...)` works in most places
* the argument to `emu.wait` can be an attotime rather than a double
This lets you use `emu.wait(...)` directly from autoboot scripts without mucking around creating coroutines.  I haven’t checked the
  performance impact.  Plugins work, script bindings that return values to C++ still work (e.g. for layout scripting).

 * Add some calls to the state machine stepping handler for non-timeout conditions that may advance it, particularly non-DMA writes
    to the FIFO
 * Always wait for FIFO to have at least one byte before sending anything
 * Properly interpret configuration flag for Save Residual Byte 16-bit DMA mode
 * Use little-endian byte order for 16-bit DMA handlers, but add alternate byte-swapping handlers for convenient use with big-endian
    systems
 * Allow 16-bit DMA handlers to access just one byte in the FIFO rather than exit MAME with an exception
 * Always honor timeout for selection arbitration (previously any event could short-circuit it)
 * Allow side effects of read handlers to be disabled for debugging

-Update accumulating relative inputs exactly once per frame. [Vas Crabb]
 * This fixes "amplification" effects that would happen if the frame rate rose above 100 Hz (whether by unthrottling or otherwise).
 * Synchronise with wall clock any time inputs are read.  Not doing this has weird effects on relative inputs with frame skipping
    and contributes to unresponsiveness of menus.
 * Reduce visual latency for mouse movement on menus when paused or skipping frames.  The rest of the code changes to menus won't
    provide benefits until draw can happen after event handling.

-apple2gs.cpp: don't allow read of write-only switches, fixes MT08564 [Peter Ferrie]

-osd/modules/input: Always use DirectInput with desktop window in background mode. [Vas Crabb]
 * There are multiple issues with what MAME was doing, but the most glaring is that it violates the DirectInput interface contract
    that requires the window associated with an open device must not be destroyed.  See documentation for
    IDirectInputDevice8::SetCooperativeLevel: "This parameter must be a valid top-level window handle that belongs to the process.
    The window associated with the device must not be destroyed while it is still active in a DirectInput device."
 * The previous code also prevented DirectInput controllers from working when using multiple windows if any window other than the
    first window had focus.
 * Also fixed SDL builds not correctly recognising when all windows lose focus, and save state menu not appearing.

-abc1600: Note failing tests. [Curt Coder]

-abc1600: Bring the mouse CPU online. [Curt Coder]

-Various updates, mostly around Lua: [Vas Crabb]
 * Compile Lua as C++.  When Lua is compiled as C, it uses setjmp/longjmp for error handling, resulting in failure to unwind
    intermediate stack frames.  Trying to ensure no objects with non-trivial destructors are in scope when raising a Lua error is
    error-prone.  In particular, converting an exception to a Lua error becomes convoluted, and raising a Lua error from a
    constructor is effectively impossible.
 * Updated Lua to 5.4.4 - this includes a brand-new garbage collector implementation with better performance.  The main thing
    removed is the deprecated bitlib.
 * Updated sol2 to version 3.3.0 - this adds support for Lua 5.4 and fixes a number of issues, including not correctly handling
    errors when Lua is built as C++.
 * Updated LuaFileSystem to version 1.8.0 - this adds support for symbolic links on Windows, as well as Lua 5.4 compatibility.
 * Updated LuaSQLite3 to version 0.9.5 - this fixes issues in multi-threaded environments, as well as Lua 5.4 compatibility.
 * Fixed double-free after attempting to construct a debugger expression from Lua with an invalid string, and exposed expression
    error to Lua in a better way.
 * Added warning level print function to Lua.
 * Fixed saving cheats with shift operators in expressions, although this code isn't actually used as there's no cheat editor.

-3rdparty: Avoid the need for -fpermissive since clang doesn't like it. [Vas Crabb]
 * I'll try to get some of this upstreamed.

New clones marked not working

Bloxeed (bootleg) [porchy]

-sega/model3.cpp: fixed ROM loading for the oceanhun sets, they now boot and run with GFX glitches [Brian Troha]

-irem/m92.cpp: Added IC locations and PLDs to most sets, minor ROM label corrections.
 [The PLD Archive, Porchy, Brian Troha, The Dumping Union]

-Updated forked linenoise to latest upstream. [Vas Crabb]
 * This removes the need to force it to build as C++, and adds proper UTF-8 support for Windows.
 * Since this is a fork of linenoise, there's no hope for getting lua-linenoise to sync with it upstream.  I made the bare minimum
    changes to keep it working, but didn't add bindings for new functionality (e.g. multi-line editing).

-Reduce warnings that need to be suppressed to build linenoise. [Vas Crabb]

 * Co-authored-by: Erik Newton <erik.newton@newteksoftware.co.uk>

-Lua engine: Better bindings for device_state_interface. [Vas Crabb]
 * This avoids creating a table every time the state property of a device is accessed, adds proper support for getting/setting
    floating/point state entries from Lua, calls the state entry's formatting method to convert to a string (for flags fields, etc.)
    and exposes more properties.
 * This is a breaking change as the exposed properties on state entries have changed, and the value property has different semantics
    for floating-point state entries.

New systems marked not working
------------------------------
Burroughs TD 831 [Wouter's Blog]

-anzterm: Move to burroughs folder [Dirk Best]

-hng64.cpp - add 'wraparound enable' bit to the tilemaps, this bit gets disabled on the fatal fury wild ambition title screen, and
 roads edge name entry screen, both cases where tilemap wrap definitely looks to need to be disabled. (#11011) [David Haywood]

-m68000: Bus and address errors do *not* disable the write part of the micro-instruction.  Fixes the delta force protections (Syntax
 Terror, Punish your machine) [Olivier Galibert]

-jaleco/tetrisp2.cpp: Added partial emulation of PC for music games. [Windy Fairy]

New working systems
-------------------
Aka Zukin [Alberto Salso, Ignacio Seki, Angelo Salese]

-apple2video: fix monochrome DHGR rendering for RGB mode (GitHub #10975) [R. Belmont]

-apple2video: Better fix for the previous issue. Now also covers IIgs mono DHR and B&W monitor modes. [R. Belmont]

-pci.cpp: add new config read/write functions to support bridges that allow software to issue both Type 0 and Type 1 config
 addresses. [R. Belmont]
 * bandit.cpp: use the new functionality in pci.cpp. [R. Belmont]
 * macpci.cpp: Fix Grand Central PCI address now that we're interpreting the config address correctly. [R. Belmont]

-Retired the over-stretched "system type" flags. [Vas Crabb]
 * Functionally, the only difference between the system definitions is that GAMEL lets you specify an additional internal layout and
    SYST lets you specify a compatible system.  COMP and CONS are just aliases for SYST - the aliases can be phased out.
 * Removed arcade.flt and mess.flt altogether - opinion seems to be split between misinterpreting them as fully supported and
    considering them unnecessary.  They were marginally useful as a performance test for makedep.py, but that isn't important.  We
    still have nl.flt as an example .flt file (although it doesn't use "-" exclude directives).
 * Moved the UI active flag from the machine to the UI manager.  Nothing else uses it anyway (it's still accessible to scripts).

-luaengine.cpp: Hopefully fix clang builds. [Vas Crabb]

-luaengine.cpp: Try to get around the clang error, attempt two. [Vas Crabb]

-sinclair/tsconf.cpp: Added NeoGS sound card and Kempston mouse. (#11016) [holub]

-Lua engine: run everything in coroutines. (#11019) [Vas Crabb]
 * This lets you use emu.wait(...) directly without mucking around creating coroutines.
 * Allow emu.wait to accept an attotime argument.
 * Added a couple more wait helper functions.

-emu/profiler.h: Actually use scope-based profiling helpers. [Vas Crabb]
 * This makes the comment at the top of emu/profile.h less dishonest, and makes it easier to write exception-safe code.
 * Got rid of some do { ... } while (0) loops that only existed so break could be used like a goto.

-emu/profile.h: Hopefully convince clang that profile scope helpers are important even in non-profile builds. [Vas Crabb]

-bus/ISA: Added HP82321A BASIC Language coprocessor (#10926) [Sven Schnelle]
 * emu: add defer_access() method, which is useful for keeping the cpu in a loop restarting the current instruction to emulate
    waitstates.
 * add HP82321A Basic Language Coprocessor This adds support for the HP82321A Basic language coprocessor, which emulates a HP9816
    system with a 68K cpu. See http://www.hpmuseum.net/display_item.php?hw=681 for more details and software to run on this card.

-minimaws: Let command-line romident identify media inside zip archives. (#11024) [wilbertpol]

-Various optimisations to code generaton. [Vas Crabb]
 * util/bitmap.cpp, util/palette.cpp: Marked lots of things constexpr. Bitmaps don't throw exceptions on allocation failure, they
    just become invalid.  Almost nothing in MAME actually checks for this.
 * emu/profiler.cpp: Abort if the profile stack overflows rather than throwing an exception.  This is a developer feature and if it
    overflows, the code is broken.  Calling a noreturn noexcept function generates less code than throwing an exception, which adds
    up.
 * util/strformat.cpp: Traded away some unnecessary flexibility for more compact code.  The stream objects must derive from
    std::basic_ostream now - they can't just be any old objects with the expected operators.

-Pacify clang, and more noexcept. [Vas Crabb]

-astrocde.xml: Use lowercase for descriptive text in descriptions. (#11023) [ArcadeShadow]
 * Lowercase on descriptive words like "Prototype", "Alt", "Bad Dump", etc.

-to_flop.xml: Cleaned up letter case in descriptions. (#11022) [ArcadeShadow]
